			CH&rsquo;IEN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE&nbsp;CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br /> <img
				src="images/chien.gif" width="40" height="29" alt="&#9776;"
				title="yang yang yang: lower trigram for Ch&rsquo;ien" /><i>below</i>
			CH&rsquo;IEN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE&nbsp;CREATIVE, HEAVEN
		</p>


		<p>The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines.&nbsp;
			These unbroken lines stand for the primal power, which is
			light&ndash;giving, active, strong, and of the spirit.&nbsp; The
			hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is without
			weakness, its essence is power or energy.&nbsp; Its image is
			heaven.&nbsp; Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed
			conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion.&nbsp;
			Time is regarded as the basis of this motion.&nbsp; Thus the hexagram
			includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time,
			that is, duration.</p>

		<p>The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a
			dual sense&mdash;in terms of its action on the universe and of its
			action on the world of men.&nbsp; In relation to the universe, the
			hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity.&nbsp; In
			relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the
			holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his
			power awakens and develops their higher nature.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			THE CREATIVE works sublime success,<br /> Furthering through
			perseverance.
		</p>

		<p>According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity,
			potentiality of success, power to further, perseverance] are
			paired.&nbsp; When an individual draws this oracle, it means that
			success will come to him from the primal depths of the universe and
			that everything depends upon his seeking his happiness and that of
			others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what is right.</p>

		<p>The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject
			of speculation at an early date.&nbsp; The Chinese word here rendered
			by &ldquo;sublime&rdquo; means literally &ldquo;head,&rdquo;
			&ldquo;origin,&rdquo; &ldquo;great.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is why
			Confucius says in explaining it: &ldquo;Great indeed is the
			generating power of the Creative; all beings owe their beginning to
			it.&nbsp; This power permeates all heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this
			attribute inheres in the other three as well.</p>

		<p>The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the
			form of ideas that have yet to become real.&nbsp; But the Creative
			furthermore has power to lend form to these archetypes of
			ideas.&nbsp; This is indicated in the word success, and the process
			is represented by an image from nature: &ldquo;The clouds pass and
			the rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their
			forms.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Applied to the human world, these attributes show the great man
			the way to notable success: &ldquo;Because he sees with great clarity
			causes and effects, he completes the six steps at the right time and
			mounts toward heaven on them at the right time, as though on six
			dragons.&rdquo;&nbsp; The six steps are the six different positions
			given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon
			symbol.&nbsp; Here it is shown that the way to success lies in
			apprehending and giving actuality to the way of the universe [tao],
			which, as a law running through end and beginning, brings about all
			phenomena in time.&nbsp; Thus each step attained forthwith becomes a
			preparation for the next.&nbsp; Time is no longer a hindrance but the
			means of making actual what is potential.</p>

		<p>The act of creation having found expression in the two
			attributes sublimity and success, the work of conservation is shown
			to be a continuous actualization and differentiation of form.&nbsp;
			This is expressed in the two terms &ldquo;furthering&rdquo;
			(literally, &ldquo;creating that which accords with the nature of a
			given being&rdquo;) and &ldquo;persevering&rdquo; (literally,
			&ldquo;correct and firm&rdquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;The course of the
			Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true,
			specific nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great
			Harmony.&nbsp; Thus does it show itself to further through
			perseverance.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man
			brings peace and security to the world through his activity in
			creating order: &ldquo;He towers high above the multitude of beings,
			and all lands are united in peace.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>
			Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the
			words &ldquo;sublime,&rdquo; &ldquo;success,&rdquo;
			&ldquo;furthering,&rdquo; &ldquo;perseverance,&rdquo; and parallels
			them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity.&nbsp; To sublimity,
			which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other
			attributes, it links love.&nbsp; To the attribute success are linked
			the mores, which regulate and organize expressions of love and
			thereby make them successful.&nbsp; The attribute furthering is
			correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which each
			receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and
			which constitutes his happiness.&nbsp; The attribute perseverance is
			correlated with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that
			happens and can therefore bring about enduring conditions.&nbsp;
			These speculations, already broached in the commentary called <i>W&ecirc;n
				Yen</i>, later formed the bridge connecting the philosophy of the
			&ldquo;five stages (elements) of change,&rdquo; as laid down in the
			Book of History (<i>Shu Ching</i>) with the philosophy of the Book of
			Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and
			negative principles.&nbsp; In the course of time this combination of
			the two systems of thought opened the way for an increasingly
			intricate number symbolism.
		</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>

		<p class="imageSub">
			The movement of heaven is full of power.<br /> Thus the superior man
			makes himself strong and untiring.
		</p>

		<p>Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram
			Ch&rsquo;ien, of which heaven is the image, indicates the movement of
			heaven.&nbsp; One complete revolution of heaven makes a day, and the
			repetition of the trigram means that each day is followed by
			another.&nbsp; This creates the idea of time.&nbsp; Since it is the
			same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the
			idea of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops
			nor slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending
			course.&nbsp; This duration in time is the image of the power
			inherent in the Creative.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop
			himself so that his influence may endure.&nbsp; He must make himself
			strong in every way, by consciously casting out all that is inferior
			and degrading.&nbsp; Thus he attains that tirelessness which depends
			upon consciously limiting the fields of his activity.</p>


		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> Hidden
				dragon.&nbsp; Do not act.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from
			that given it in the Western world.&nbsp; The dragon is a symbol of
			the electrically charged, dynamic, arousing force that manifests
			itself in the thunderstorm.&nbsp; In winter this energy withdraws
			into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active again,
			appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning.&nbsp; As a result the
			creative forces on earth begin to stir again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and
			therefore has no effect.&nbsp; In terms of human affairs, this
			symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized.&nbsp; Nonetheless
			he remains true to himself.&nbsp; He does not allow himself to be
			influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his
			strength, he bides his time.&nbsp; Hence it is wise for the man who
			consults the oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength
			of patience.&nbsp; The time will fulfill itself.&nbsp; One need not
			fear lest strong will should not prevail; the main thing is not to
			expend one&rsquo;s powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by
			force something for which the time is not yet ripe.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Dragon appearing in the field.<br /> It furthers one to see the
				great man.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here the effects of the light&ndash;giving power begin to
			manifest themselves.&nbsp; In terms of human affairs, this means that
			the great man makes his appearance in his chosen field of
			activity.&nbsp; As yet he has no commanding position but is still
			with his peers.&nbsp; However, what distinguishes him from the others
			is his seriousness of purpose, his unqualified reliability, and the
			influence he exerts on his environment without conscious
			effort.&nbsp; Such a man is destined to gain great influence and to
			set the world in order.&nbsp; Therefore it is favorable to see him.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> All
				day long the superior man is creatively active.<br /> At nightfall
				his mind is still beset with cares.<br /> Danger.&nbsp; No blame.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A sphere of influence opens up for the great man.&nbsp; His
			fame begins to spread.&nbsp; The masses flock to him.&nbsp; His inner
			power is adequate to the increased outer activity.&nbsp; There are
			all sorts of things to be done, and when others are at rest in the
			evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him.&nbsp; But danger
			lurks here at the place of transition from lowliness to the
			heights.&nbsp; Many a great man has been ruined because the masses
			flocked to him and swept him into their course.&nbsp; Ambition has
			destroyed his integrity.&nbsp; However, true greatness is not
			impaired by temptations.&nbsp; He who remains in touch with the time
			that is dawning, and with its demands, is prudent enough to avoid all
			pitfalls, and remains blameless.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br />
				Wavering flight over the depths.<br /> No blame.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A place of transition has been reached, and free choice can
			enter in.&nbsp; A twofold possibility is presented to the great man:
			he can soar to the heights and play an important part in the world,
			or he can withdraw into solitude and develop himself.&nbsp; He can go
			the way of the hero or that of the holy sage who seeks
			seclusion.&nbsp; There is no general law to say which of the two is
			the right way.&nbsp; Each one in this situation must make a free
			choice according to the inner law of his being.&nbsp; If the
			individual acts consistently and is true to himself, he will find the
			way that is appropriate for him.&nbsp; This way is right for him and
			without blame.</p>



		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br />
				Flying dragon in the heavens.<br /> It furthers one to see the
				great man.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here the great man has attained the sphere of the heavenly
			beings.&nbsp; His influence spreads and becomes visible throughout
			the whole world.&nbsp; Everyone who sees him may count himself
			blessed.&nbsp; Confucius says about this line:</p>
		<p>&laquo;Things that accord in tone vibrate together.&nbsp;
			Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one
			another.&nbsp; Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is
			dry.&nbsp; Clouds (the breath of heaven) follow the dragon, wind (the
			breath of earth) follows the tiger.&nbsp; Thus the sage arises, and
			all creatures follow him with their eyes.&nbsp; What is born of
			heaven feels related to what is above.&nbsp; What is born of earth
			feels related to what is below.&nbsp; Each follows its kind.&raquo;</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> Arrogant
				dragon will have cause to repent.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When a man seeks to climb so high that he loses touch with the
			rest of mankind, he becomes isolated, and this necessarily leads to
			failure.&nbsp; This line warns against titanic aspirations that
			exceed one&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; A precipitous fall would
			follow.&nbsp;</p>



		<ul class="allLines">
			<li>When <strong>all the lines are nines</strong>, it means:<br />
				There appears a flight of dragons without heads.<br /> Good
				fortune.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When all the lines are nines, it means that the whole hexagram
			is in motion and changes into the hexagram K&rsquo;un, THE RECEPTIVE,
			whose character is devotion.&nbsp; The strength of the Creative and
			the mildness of the Receptive unite.&nbsp; Strength is indicated by
			the flight of dragons, mildness by the fact that their heads are
			hidden.&nbsp; This means that mildness in action joined to strength
			of decision brings good fortune.</p>

		<h2>2. &nbsp; K&rsquo;un / The Receptive</h2>

		<p class="subTitle">
			<img src="images/kun.gif" width="40" height="28"
				title="upper trigram for K&rsquo;un" alt="&#9783;" /><i>above</i>
			K&rsquo;UN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br /> <img
				src="images/kun.gif" width="40" height="28"
				title="lower trigram for K&rsquo;un" alt="&#9783;" /><i>below</i>
			K&rsquo;UN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
		</p>
		<p>
			This hexagram is made up of broken lines only.&nbsp; The broken line
			represents the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin.&nbsp;
			The attribute of the hexagram is devotion; its image is the
			earth.&nbsp; It is the perfect complement of <a class="inlineRef"
				href="#1" title="hexagram #1 Ch&rsquo;ien">THE CREATIVE</a>&mdash;the
			complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does not combat the
			Creative but completes it.&nbsp; It represents nature in contrast to
			spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the
			female&ndash;maternal as against the male&ndash;paternal.&nbsp;
			However, as applied to human affairs, the principle of this
			complementary relationship is found not only in the relation between
			man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and
			between father and son.&nbsp; Indeed, even in the individual this
			duality appears in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the
			world of the senses.
		</p>
		<p>But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because
			there is a clearly defined hierarchic relationship between the two
			principles.&nbsp; In itself of course the Receptive is just as
			important as the Creative, but the attribute of devotion defines the
			place occupied by this primal power in relation to the
			Creative.&nbsp; For the Receptive must be activated and led by the
			Creative; then it is productive of good.&nbsp; Only when it abandons
			this position and tries to stand as an equal side by side with the
			Creative, does it become evil.&nbsp; The result then is opposition to
			and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of evil to
			both.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,<br /> Furthering through
			the perseverance of a mare.<br /> If the superior man undertakes
			something and tries to lead,<br /> He goes astray;<br /> But if he
			follows, he finds guidance.<br /> It is favorable to find friends in
			the west and south,<br /> To forego friends in the east and north.<br />
			Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.
		</p>
		<p>The four fundamental aspects of the
			Creative&mdash;&ldquo;sublime success, furthering through
			perseverance&rdquo;&mdash;are also attributed to the Receptive.&nbsp;
			Here, however, the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that
			of a mare.&nbsp; The Receptive connotes spatial reality in contrast
			to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative.&nbsp; The potential
			becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a specifically
			qualifying definition.&nbsp; Thus the qualification, &ldquo;of a
			mare,&rdquo; is here added to the idea of perseverance.&nbsp; The
			horse belongs to earth just as the dragon belongs to heaven.&nbsp;
			Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a symbol of the vast
			expanse of the earth.&nbsp; This is the symbol chosen because the
			mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the
			gentleness and devotion of the cow.</p>
		<p>Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the
			myriad impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses
			real.&nbsp; Nature&rsquo;s richness lies in its power to nourish all
			living things; its greatness lies in its power to give them beauty
			and splendor.&nbsp; Thus it prospers all that lives.&nbsp; It is the
			Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the
			Receptive.&nbsp; Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the
			hexagram indicates is action in conformity with the situation.&nbsp;
			The person in question is not in an independent position, but is
			acting as an assistant.&nbsp; This means that he must achieve
			something.&nbsp; It is not his task to try to lead&mdash;that would
			only make him lose the way&mdash;but to let himself be led.&nbsp; If
			he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of acceptance, he is sure
			to find the right guidance.&nbsp; The superior man lets himself be
			guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation
			what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from fate.</p>
		<p>Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends
			and helpers in the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be
			realized are firmly set.&nbsp; The time of toil and effort is
			indicated by the west and south, for west and south symbolize the
			place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature does in
			summer and autumn.&nbsp; If in that situation one does not mobilize
			all one&rsquo;s powers, the work to be accomplished will not be
			done.&nbsp; Hence to find friends there means to find guidance.&nbsp;
			But in addition to the time of toil and effort, there is also a time
			of planning, and for this we need this solitude.&nbsp; The east
			symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and
			the north the place where he reports on what he has done.&nbsp; At
			that time he must be alone and objective.&nbsp; In this sacred hour
			he must do without companions, so that the purity of the moment may
			not be spoiled by fictional hates and favoritism.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			The earth&rsquo;s condition is receptive devotion.<br /> Thus the
			superior man who has breadth of character<br /> Carries the outer
			world.
		</p>
		<p>Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one
			earth.&nbsp; In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram
			implies duration in time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling
			connotes the solidity and extension in space by virtue of which the
			earth is able to carry and preserve all things that live and move
			upon it.&nbsp; The earth in its devotion carries all things, good and
			evil, without exception.&nbsp; In the same way the superior man gives
			to his character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is
			able both to support and to bear with people and things.</p>



		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> When
				there is hoarfrost underfoot,<br /> Solid ice is not far off.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Just as the light&ndash;giving power represents life, so the
			dark power, the shadowy, represents death.&nbsp; When the first
			hoarfrost comes in the autumn, the power of darkness and cold is just
			at its beginning.&nbsp; After these first warnings, signs of death
			will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark
			winter with its ice is here.</p>
		<p>In life it is the same.&nbsp; After certain scarcely noticeable
			signs of decay have appeared, they go on increasing until final
			dissolution comes&nbsp; But in life precautions can be taken by
			heeding the first signs of decay and checking them in time.</p>

		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Straight, square, great.<br /> Without purpose,<br /> Yet nothing
				remains unfurthered.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the
			square.&nbsp; Thus squareness is a primary quality of the
			earth.&nbsp; On the other hand, movement in a straight line, as well
			as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative.&nbsp; But all
			square things have their origin in a straight line and in turn form
			solid bodies.&nbsp; In mathematics, when we discriminate between
			lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from
			straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes.&nbsp;
			The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative
			and makes them its own.&nbsp; Thus a square develops out of a
			straight line and a cube out of a square.&nbsp; This is compliance
			with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing
			added.&nbsp; Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose
			of its own, nor of any effort; yet everything turns out as it should.
		</p>
		<p>Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its
			straightness.&nbsp; It is calm and still: this is its
			foursquareness.&nbsp; It tolerates all creatures equally: this is its
			greatness.&nbsp; Therefore it attains what is right for all without
			artifice or special intentions.&nbsp; Man achieves the height of
			wisdom when all that he does is as self&ndash;evident as what nature
			does.</p>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> Hidden
				lines.<br /> One is able to remain persevering.<br /> If by chance
				you are in the service of a king,<br /> Seek not works, but bring
				to completion.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If a man is free of vanity he is able to conceal his abilities
			and keep them from attracting attention too soon; thus he can mature
			undisturbed.&nbsp; If conditions demand it, he can also enter public
			life, but that too he does with restraint.&nbsp; The wise man gladly
			leaves fame to others.&nbsp; He does not seek to have credited to
			himself things that stand accomplished, but hopes to release active
			forces; that is, he completes his works in such a manner that they
			may bear fruit for the future.</p>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br /> A
				tied&ndash;up sack.&nbsp; No blame, no praise.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The dark element opens when it moves and closes when at
			rest.&nbsp; The strictest reticence is indicated here.&nbsp; The time
			is dangerous , because any degree of prominence leads either to the
			enmity of irresistible antagonists if one challenges them or to
			misconceived recognition if one is complaisant.&nbsp; Therefore a man
			ought to maintain reserve, be it in solitude or in the turmoil of the
			world, for there too he can hide himself so well that no one knows
			him.</p>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br /> A
				yellow lower garment brings supreme good fortune.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Yellow is the color of the earth and of the middle; it is the
			symbol of that which is reliable and genuine.&nbsp; The lower garment
			is inconspicuously decorated&mdash;the symbol of aristocratic
			reserve.&nbsp; When anyone is called upon to work in a prominent but
			not independent position, true success depends on the utmost
			discretion.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s genuineness and refinement should not
			reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves only
			indirectly as an effect from within.</p>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> Dragons fight
				in the meadow.<br /> Their blood is black and yellow.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the top place the dark element should yield to the
			light.&nbsp; If it attempts to maintain a position to which it is not
			entitled and to rule instead of serving, it draws down upon itself
			the anger of the strong.&nbsp; A struggle ensues in which it is
			overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides.&nbsp; The dragon,
			symbol of heaven, comes to fight the false dragon that symbolized the
			inflation of the earth principle.&nbsp; Midnight blue is the color of
			heaven; yellow is the color of earth.&nbsp; Therefore, when black and
			yellow blood flow, it is a sign that in this unnatural contest both
			primal powers suffer injury.</p>

		<ul class="allLines">

			<li>When <strong>all the lines are sixes</strong>, it means:<br />
				Lasting perseverance furthers.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When nothing but sixes appears, the hexagram of THE RECEPTIVE
			changes into the hexagram of THE CREATIVE.&nbsp; By holding fast to
			what is right, it gains the power of enduring.&nbsp; There is indeed
			no advance, but neither is there retrogression.</p>

			CH&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE AROUSING, THUNDER
		</p>
		<p>The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of
			grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the
			earth&mdash;hence the meaning, &ldquo;difficulty at the
			beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hexagram indicates the way in which
			heaven and earth bring forth individual beings.&nbsp; It is their
			first meeting, which is beset with difficulties.&nbsp; The lower
			trigram Ch&ecirc;n is the Arousing; its motion is upward and its
			image is thunder.&nbsp; The upper trigram K&rsquo;an stands for the
			Abysmal, the dangerous.&nbsp; Its motion is downward and its image is
			rain.&nbsp; The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion;
			thunder and rain fill the air.&nbsp; But the chaos clears up.&nbsp;
			While the Abysmal sinks, the upward movement eventually passes beyond
			the danger.&nbsp; A thunderstorm brings release from tension, and all
			things breathe freely again.</p>

		<p class="judgSub">
			DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING works supreme success,<br /> Furthering
			through perseverance.<br /> Nothing should be undertaken.<br /> It
			furthers one to appoint helpers.
		</p>
		<p>Times of growth are beset with difficulties.&nbsp; They
			resemble a first birth.&nbsp; But these difficulties arise from the
			very profusion of all that is struggling to attain form.&nbsp;
			Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a
			prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger.&nbsp;
			When it is a man&rsquo;s fate to undertake such new beginnings,
			everything is still unformed, dark.&nbsp; Hence he must hold back,
			because any premature move might bring disaster.&nbsp; Likewise, it
			is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome the chaos
			he needs helpers.&nbsp; This is not to say, however, that he himself
			should look on passively at what is happening.&nbsp; He must lend his
			hand and participate with inspiration and guidance.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			Clouds and thunder:<br /> The image of DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING.<br />
			Thus the superior man<br /> Brings order out of confusion.
		</p>
		<p>Clouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative
			lines; this means that in the chaos of difficulty at the beginning,
			order is already implicit.&nbsp; So too the superior man has to
			arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of such times of
			beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted tangle
			and binds them into skeins.&nbsp; In order to find one&rsquo;s place
			in the infinity of being, one must be able both to separate and to
			unite.</p>

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If a person encounters a hindrance at the beginning of an
			enterprise, he must not try to force advance but must pause and take
			thought.&nbsp; However, nothing should put him off his course; he
			must persevere and constantly keep the goal in sight.&nbsp; It is
			important to seek out the right assistants, but he can find them only
			if he avoids arrogance and associates with his fellows in a spirit of
			humility.&nbsp; Only then will he attract those with whose help he
			can combat the difficulties.</p>


		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />

				years&mdash;then she pledges herself.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We find ourselves beset by difficulties and hindrances.&nbsp;
			Suddenly there is a turn of affairs, as if someone were coming up
			with a horse and wagon and unhitching them.&nbsp; This event comes so
			unexpectedly that we assume the newcomer to be a robber.&nbsp;
			Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil intentions but seeks
			to be friendly and to offer help.&nbsp; But this offer is not to be
			accepted, because it does not come from the right quarter.&nbsp; We
			must wait until the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle
			of time.&nbsp; Then normal conditions return of themselves, and we
			can join forces with the friend intended for us.</p>
		<p>Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her
			lover in face of grave conflicts, the hexagram gives counsel for a
			special situation.&nbsp; When in times of difficulty a hindrance is
			encountered and unexpected relief is offered from a source unrelated
			to us, we must be careful and not take upon ourselves any obligations
			entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of decision is
			impaired.&nbsp; If we bide our time, things will quiet down again,
			and we shall attain what we have hoped for.</p>

		<ul class="notRuler">

				humiliation.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If a man tries to hunt in a strange forest and has no guide, he
			loses his way.&nbsp; When he finds himself in difficulties he must
			not try to steal out of them unthinkingly and without guidance.&nbsp;
			Fate cannot be duped; premature effort, without the necessary
			guidance, ends in failure and disgrace.&nbsp; Therefore the superior

			wish rather than to provoke failure and humiliation by trying to
			force its fulfillment.</p>

		</ul>

		<p>We are in a situation in which it is our duty to act, but we
			lack sufficient power.&nbsp; However, an opportunity to make

			false pride nor false reserve should deter us.&nbsp; Bringing oneself
			to take the first step, even when it involves a certain degree of

		<p>An individual is in a position in which he cannot so express
			his good intentions that they will actually take shape and be

			does.&nbsp; He should then be cautious and proceed step by

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE ABYSMAL, WATER
		</p>
		<p>In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two
			different ways.&nbsp; The image of the upper trigram, K&ecirc;n, is
			the mountain, that of the lower, K&rsquo;an, is water; the spring
			rising at the foot of the mountain is the image of inexperienced
			youth.&nbsp; Keeping still is the attribute of the upper trigram;
			that of the lower is the abyss, danger.&nbsp; Stopping in perplexity
			on the brink of a dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of
			youth.&nbsp; However, the two trigrams also show the way of
			overcoming the follies of youth.&nbsp; Water is something that of
			necessity flows on.&nbsp; When the spring gushes forth, it does not
			know at first where it will go.&nbsp; But its steady flow fills up
			the deep place blocking its progress, and success is attained.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.<br /> It is not I who seek the young
			fool;<br /> The young fool seeks me.<br /> At the first oracle I
			inform him.<br /> If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.<br />
			If he importunes, I give him no information.<br /> Perseverance
			furthers.<br />
		</p>
		<p>In the time of youth, folly is not an evil.&nbsp; One may
			succeed in spite of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and
			has the right attitude toward him.&nbsp; This means, first of all,
			that the youth himself must be conscious of his lack of experience
			and must seek out the teacher.&nbsp; Without this modesty and this
			interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity,
			which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the
			teacher.&nbsp; This is the reason why the teacher must wait to be
			sought out instead of offering himself.&nbsp; Only thus can the
			instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.</p>
		<p>A teacher&rsquo;s answer to the question of a pupil ought to be
			clear and definite like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it
			ought to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and a basis
			for decision.&nbsp; If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is
			kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher.&nbsp; He does well to
			ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and
			refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt.</p>
		<p>Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until the
			points are mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow.&nbsp;
			Thus the hexagram counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:<br /> The image of
			YOUTH.<br /> Thus the superior man fosters his character<br /> By
			thoroughness in all that he does.<br />
		</p>
		<p>A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by
			filling up all the hollow places in its path.&nbsp; In the same way
			character is developed by thoroughness that skips nothing but, like
			water, gradually and steadily fills up all gaps and so flows onward.
		</p>


		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> To make
				a fool develop<br /> It furthers one to apply discipline.<br />
				The fetters should be removed.<br /> To go on in this way brings
				humiliation.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Law is the beginning of education.&nbsp; Youth in its
			inexperience is inclined at first to take everything carelessly and
			playfully.&nbsp; It must be shown the seriousness of life.&nbsp; A
			certain measure of taking oneself in hand, brought about by strict
			discipline, is a good thing.&nbsp; He who plays with life never
			amounts to anything.&nbsp; However, discipline should not degenerate
			into drill.&nbsp; Continuous drill has a humiliating effect and
			cripples a man&rsquo;s powers.</p>



		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br /> To
				bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune.<br /> To know
				how to take women<br /> Brings good fortune.<br /> The son is
				capable of taking charge of the household.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These lines picture a man who has no external power, but who
			has enough strength of mind to bear his burden of
			responsibility.&nbsp; He has the inner superiority and that enable
			him to tolerate with kindliness the shortcomings of human
			folly.&nbsp; The same attitude is owed to women as the weaker
			sex.&nbsp; One must understand them and give them recognition in a
			spirit of chivalrous consideration.&nbsp; Only this combination of
			inner strength with outer reserve enables one to take on the
			responsibility of directing a larger social body with real success.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> Take
				not a maiden who, when she sees a man of bronze,<br /> Loses
				possession of herself.<br /> Nothing furthers.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A weak, inexperienced man, struggling to rise, easily loses his
			own individuality when he slavishly imitates a strong personality of
			higher station.&nbsp; He is like a girl throwing herself away when
			she meets a strong man.&nbsp; Such a servile approach should not be
			encouraged, because it is bad both for the youth and the
			teacher.&nbsp; A girl owes it to her dignity to wait until she is
			wooed.&nbsp; In both cases it is undignified to offer oneself, and no
			good comes of accepting such an offer.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br />
				Entangled folly bring humiliation.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For youthful folly it is the most hopeless thing to entangle
			itself in empty imaginings.&nbsp; The more obstinately it clings to
			such unreal fantasies, the more certainly will humiliation overtake
			it.</p>
		<p>Often the teacher, when confronted with such entangled folly,
			has no other course but to leave the fool to himself for a time, not
			sparing him the humiliation that results.&nbsp; This is frequently
			the only means of rescue.</p>


		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br />
				Childlike folly brings good fortune.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>An inexperienced person who seeks instruction in a childlike
			and unassuming way is on the right path, for the man devoid of
			arrogance who subordinates himself to his teacher will certainly be
			helped.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> In punishing
				folly<br /> It does not further one<br /> To commit
				transgressions.<br /> The only thing that furthers<br /> Is to
				prevent transgressions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Sometimes an incorrigible fool must be punished.&nbsp; He who
			will not heed will be made to feel.&nbsp; This punishment is quite
			different from a preliminary shaking up.&nbsp; But the penalty should
			not be imposed in anger; it must be restricted to an objective
			guarding against unjustified excesses.&nbsp; Punishment is never an
			end in itself but serves merely to restore order.</p>
		<p>This applies not only in regard to education but also in regard
			to the measures taken by a government against a populace guilty of
			transgressions.&nbsp; Governmental interference should always be
			merely preventive and should have as its sole aim the establishment
			of public security and peace.</p>

		</p>
		<p>All beings have need of nourishment from above.&nbsp; But the
			gift of food comes in its own time, and for this one must wait.&nbsp;
			This hexagram shows the clouds in the heavens, giving rain to refresh
			all that grows and to provide mankind with food and drink.&nbsp; The
			rain will come in its own time.&nbsp; We cannot make it come; we have
			to wait for it.&nbsp; The idea of waiting is further suggested by the
			attributes of the two trigrams&mdash;strength within, danger in
			front.&nbsp; Strength in the face of danger does not plunge ahead but
			bides its time, whereas weakness in the face of danger grows agitated
			and has not the patience to wait.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>

		<p class="judgSub">
			WAITING.&nbsp; If you are sincere,<br /> You have light and success.<br />
			Perseverance brings good fortune.<br /> It furthers one to cross the
			great water.<br />
		</p>
		<p>Waiting is not mere empty hoping.&nbsp; It has the inner
			certainty of reaching the goal.&nbsp; Such certainty alone gives that
			light which leads to success.&nbsp; This leads to the perseverance
			that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the great water.
		</p>
		<p>One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome.&nbsp;
			Weakness and impatience can do nothing.&nbsp; Only a strong man can
			stand up to his fate, for his inner security enables him to endure to
			the end.&nbsp; This strength shows itself in uncompromising
			truthfulness [with himself].&nbsp; It is only when we have the
			courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of
			self&ndash;deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of
			events, by which the path to success may be recognized.&nbsp; This
			recognition must be followed by resolute and persevering
			action.&nbsp; For only the man who goes to meet his fate resolutely
			is equipped to deal with it adequately.&nbsp; Then he will be able to
			cross the great water&mdash;that is to say, he will be capable of
			making the necessary decision and of surmounting the danger.</p>

		<p>When clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will
			rain.&nbsp; There is nothing to do but to wait until after the rain
			falls.&nbsp; It is the same in life when destiny is at work.&nbsp; We
			should not worry and seek to shape the future by interfering in
			things before the time is ripe.&nbsp; We should quietly fortify the
			body with food and drink and the mind with gladness and good
			cheer.&nbsp; Fate comes when it will, and thus we are ready.</p>

				No blame.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The danger is not yet close.&nbsp; One is still waiting on the
			open plain.&nbsp; Conditions are still simple, yet there is a feeling
			of something impending.&nbsp; One must continue to lead a regular
			life as long as possible.&nbsp; Only in this way does one guard
			against a premature waste of strength, keep free of blame and error
			that would become a source of weakness later on.</p>

			<li>Nine in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Waiting on the sand.<br /> There is some gossip.<br /> The end

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The danger gradually comes closer.&nbsp; Sand is near the bank
			of the river, and the water means danger.&nbsp; Disagreements crop
			up.&nbsp; General unrest can easily develop in such times, and we lay
			the blame on one another.&nbsp; He who stays calm will succeed in
			making things go well in the end.&nbsp; Slander will be silenced if

			<li>Nine in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br />

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Mud is no place for waiting, since it is already being washed
			by the water of the stream.&nbsp; Instead of having gathered strength
			to cross the stream at one try, one has made a premature start that
			has got him no farther than the muddy bank.&nbsp; Such an unfavorable
			position invites enemies from without, who naturally take advantage
			of it.&nbsp; Caution and a sense of the seriousness of the situation
			are all that can keep one from injury.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br />
				Waiting in blood.<br /> Get out of the pit.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The situation is extremely dangerous.&nbsp; It is of utmost
			gravity now&mdash;a matter of life and death.&nbsp; Bloodshed seems
			imminent.&nbsp; There is no going forward or backward; we are cut off
			as if in a pit.&nbsp; Now we must simply stand fast and let fate take
			its course.&nbsp; This composure, which keeps us from aggravating the
			trouble by anything we might do, is the only way of getting out of
			the dangerous pit.</p>



		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br />

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Even in the midst of danger there come intervals of peace when things
			go relatively well.&nbsp; If we possess enough inner strength, we
			shall take advantage of these intervals to fortify ourselves for
			renewed struggle.&nbsp; We must know how to enjoy the moment without
			being deflected from the goal, for perseverance is needed to remain
			victorious. <br />&nbsp; <br /> This is true in public life as
			well; it is not possible to achieve everything all at once.&nbsp; The
			height of wisdom is to allow people enough recreation to quicken
			pleasure in their work until the task is completed.&nbsp; Herein lies
			the secret of the whole hexagram.&nbsp; It differs from Chien
			OBSTRUCTION (39), in the fact that in this instance, while waiting,

		</ul>
		<p>The waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted.&nbsp;
			One falls into the pit and must yield to the inevitable.&nbsp;
			Everything seems to have been in vain.&nbsp; But precisely in this
			extremity things take an unforeseen turn.&nbsp; Without a move on
			one&rsquo;s own part, there is outside intervention.&nbsp; At first
			one cannot be sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction?
			A person in this situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw
			into himself with a sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet the new
			turn with respect.&nbsp; Thus he ultimately escapes the danger, and
			all goes well.&nbsp; Even happy turns of fortune often come in a form
			that at first seems strange to us.</p>

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE ABYSMAL, WATER
		</p>
		<p>The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward
			movement; the lower trigram, water, in accordance with its nature,
			tends downward.&nbsp; Thus the two halves move away from each other,
			giving rise to the idea of conflict.</p>
		<p>The attribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal
			is danger, guile.&nbsp; Where cunning has force before it, there is
			conflict.</p>
		<p>A third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is
			presented by the combination of deep cunning within and fixed
			determination outwardly.&nbsp; A person of this character will
			certainly be quarrelsome.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			CONFLICT.&nbsp; You are sincere<br /> And are being obstructed.<br />
			A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.<br /> Going through to
			the end brings misfortune.<br /> It furthers one to see the great
			man.<br /> It does not further one to cross the great water.<br />
		</p>
		<p>Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and
			runs into opposition.&nbsp; If one is not convinced of being in the
			right, opposition leads to craftiness or high&ndash;handed
			encroachment but not to open conflict.</p>
		<p>If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in
			being so clear&ndash;headed and inwardly strong that he is always
			ready to come to terms by meeting the opponent halfway.&nbsp; To
			carry one the conflict to the bitter end has evil effects even when
			one is the right, because the enmity is then perpetuated.&nbsp; It is
			important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man whose
			authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or
			assure a just decision.&nbsp; In times of strife, crossing the great
			water is to be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be
			begun, because in order to be successful they require concerted unity
			of forces.&nbsp; Conflict within weakens the power to conquer danger
			without.</p>

			Heaven and water go their opposite ways:<br /> The image of
			CONFLICT.<br /> Thus in all his transactions the superior man<br />

		</p>
		<p>The image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in
			the opposing tendencies of the two trigrams.&nbsp; Once these
			opposing tendencies appear, conflict is inevitable.&nbsp; To avoid
			it, therefore, everything must be taken carefully into consideration
			in the very beginning.&nbsp; If rights and duties are exactly
			defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals
			harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.</p>

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE ABYSMAL, WATER
		</p>
		<p>This hexagram is made up of the trigrams K&rsquo;an, water, and
			K&rsquo;un, earth, and thus it symbolizes the ground water stored up
			in the earth.&nbsp; In the same way military strength is stored up in
			the mass of the people&mdash;invisible in times of peace but always
			ready for use as a source of power.&nbsp; The attributes of the two
			trigrams are danger inside and obedience outside.&nbsp; This points
			to the nature of an army, which at the core is dangerous while
			discipline and obedience must prevail outside.</p>
		<p>Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is
			the strong nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all
			yielding, are subordinate.&nbsp; This line indicates a commander,
			because it stands in the middle of one of the two trigrams.&nbsp; But
			since it is in the lower rather than the upper trigram, it represents
			not the ruler but the efficient general, who maintains obedience in
			the army by his authority.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			THE ARMY.&nbsp; The army needs perseverance<br /> And a strong man.<br />
			Good fortune without blame.<br />
		</p>
		<p>An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a
			fighting force. &nbsp; Without strict discipline nothing can be
			accomplished, but this discipline must not be achieved by
			force.&nbsp; It requires a strong man who captures the hearts of the
			people and awakens their enthusiasm.&nbsp; In order that he may
			develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler,
			who must entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war
			lasts.&nbsp; But war is always a dangerous thing and brings with it
			destruction and devastation.&nbsp; Therefore it should not be
			resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used as a
			last recourse.</p>
		<p>The justifying cause of war, and clear and intelligible war
			aims, ought to be explained to the people by an experienced
			leader.&nbsp; Unless there is a quite definite war aim to which the
			people can consciously pledge themselves, the unity and strength of
			conviction that lead to victory will not be forthcoming.&nbsp; But
			the leader must also look to it that the passion of war and the
			delirium of victory do not give rise to unjust acts that will not
			meet with general approval..&nbsp; If justice and perseverance are
			the basis of action, all goes well.</p>
		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			In the middle of the earth is water:<br /> The image of THE ARMY.<br />
			Thus the superior man increases his masses<br /> By generosity
			toward the people.<br />
		</p>
		<p>Ground water is invisibly present within the earth.&nbsp; In
			the same way the military power of a people is invisibly present in
			the masses.&nbsp; When danger threatens, every peasant becomes a
			soldier; when the war ends, he goes back to his plow.&nbsp; He who is
			generous toward the people wins their love, and a people living under
			a mild rule becomes strong and powerful.&nbsp; Only a people
			economically strong can be important in military power.&nbsp; Such
			power must therefore be cultivated by improving the economic
			condition of the people and by humane government.&nbsp; Only when
			there is this invisible bond between government and people, so that
			the people are sheltered by their government as ground water is
			sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a victorious war.</p>


		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> An army
				must set forth in proper order.<br /> If the order is not good,
				misfortune threatens.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>At the beginning of a military enterprise, order is
			imperative.&nbsp; A just and valid cause must exist, and the
			obedience and coordination of the troops must be well organized,
			otherwise the result is inevitably failure.</p>



		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br /> In
				the midst of the army.<br /> Good fortune.&nbsp; No blame.<br />
				The king bestows a triple decoration.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The leader should be in the midst of his army, in touch with
			it, sharing good and bad with the masses he leads.&nbsp; This alone
			makes him equal to the heavy demands made upon him.&nbsp; He needs
			also the recognition of the ruler.&nbsp; The decorations he receives
			are justified, because there is no question of personal preferment
			here: the whole army, whose center he is, is honored in his person.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br />
				Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon.<br /> Misfortune.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Here we have a choice of two explanations.&nbsp; One points to defeat
			because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the
			command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the
			expression, &ldquo;carries corpses in the wagon,&rdquo; is
			interpreted differently.&nbsp; At burials and at sacrifices to the
			dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice
			was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the
			dead man&rsquo;s place and was honored as his representative.&nbsp;
			On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a
			&ldquo;corpse boy&rdquo; is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words,
			that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has
			been usurped by others.&nbsp; Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up
			if it is inferred that there has been an error in copying.&nbsp; The
			character <i>fan</i>, meaning &ldquo;all,&rdquo; may have been
			misread as <i>shih</i>, which means &ldquo;corpse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
			Allowing for this error, the meaning would be that if the multitude
			assumes leadership of the army (rides in the wagon), misfortune will
			ensue.
		</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br /> The
				army retreats.&nbsp; No blame.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the face of a superior enemy, with whom it would be hopeless
			to engage in battle, an orderly retreat is the only correct
			procedure, because it will save the army from defeat and
			disintegration.&nbsp; It is by no means a sign of courage or strength
			to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle regardless of
			circumstances.</p>



		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br /> There
				is game in the field.<br /> It furthers one to catch it.<br />
				Without blame.<br /> Let the eldest lead the army.<br /> The
				younger transports corpses;<br /> Then perseverance brings
				misfortune.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Game is in the field&mdash;it has left its usual haunts in the
			forest and is devastating the fields.&nbsp; This points to an enemy
			invasion.&nbsp; Energetic combat and punishment are here thoroughly
			justified, but they must not degenerate into a wild melee in which
			everyone fends for himself.&nbsp; Despite the greatest degree of
			perseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune.&nbsp; The
			army must be directed by an experienced leader.&nbsp; It is a matter
			of waging war, not of permitting the mob to slaughter all who fall
			into their hands; if they do, defeat will be the result, and despite
			all perseverance there is danger of misfortune.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> The great
				prince issues commands,<br /> Founds states, vests families with
				fiefs.<br /> Inferior people should not be employed.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The war has ended successfully, victory is won, and the king
			divided estates and fiefs among his faithful vassals.&nbsp; But it is
			important that inferior people should not come into power.&nbsp; If
			they have helped, let them be paid off with money, but they should
			not be awarded lands or the privileges of rulers, lest power be
			abused.</p>

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
		</p>
		<p>The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever
			they can, as for example in the ocean, where all the rivers come
			together.&nbsp; Symbolically this connotes holding together and the
			laws that regulate it.&nbsp; The same idea is suggested by the fact
			that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the place of the
			ruler, are yielding.&nbsp; The yielding lines hold together because
			they are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position,
			a man who is their center of union.&nbsp; Moreover, this strong and
			guiding personality in turn holds together with the others, finding
			in them the complement of his own nature.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.<br /> Inquire of the oracle
			once again<br /> Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and
			perseverance;<br /> Then there is no blame.<br /> Those who are
			uncertain gradually join.<br /> Whoever comes too late<br /> Meets
			with misfortune.
		</p>
		<p>What is required is that we unite with others, in order that
			all may complement and aid one another through holding
			together.&nbsp; But such holding together calls for a central figure
			around whom other persons may unite.&nbsp; To become a center of
			influence holding people together is a grave matter and fraught with
			great responsibility.&nbsp; It requires greatness of spirit,
			consistency, and strength.&nbsp; Therefore let him who wishes to
			gather others about him ask himself whether he is equal to the
			undertaking, for anyone attempting the task without a real calling
			for it only makes confusion worse than if no union at all had taken
			place.</p>
		<p>But when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are
			hesitant or uncertain gradually come in of their own accord.&nbsp;
			Late&ndash;comers must suffer the consequences, for in holding
			together the question of the right time is also important.&nbsp;
			Relationships are formed and firmly established according to definite
			inner laws.&nbsp; Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he
			who comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer
			for it if, as a straggler, he finds the door locked.</p>
		<p>If a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not
			feel strong enough to function as the center, it is his duty to
			become a member of some other organic fellowship.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			On the earth is water:<br /> The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.<br />
			Thus the kings of antiquity<br /> Bestowed the different states as
			fiefs<br /> And cultivated friendly relations<br /> With the feudal
			lords.
		</p>
		<p>Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings
			fast to it.&nbsp; The social organization of ancient China was based
			on this principle of the holding together of dependents and
			rulers.&nbsp; Water flows to unite with water, because all parts of
			it are subject to the same laws.&nbsp; So too should human society
			hold together through a community of interests that allows each
			individual to feel himself a member of a whole.&nbsp; The central
			power of a social organization must see to it that every member finds
			that his true interest lies in holding together with it, as was the
			case in the paternal relationship between king and vassals in ancient
			China.</p>

		</ul>
		<p>Fundamental sincerity is the only proper basis for forming

			intimacy through force of habit.&nbsp; Needless to say, this would
			have evil consequences.&nbsp; Maintaining sociability without

		<p>Here the relations with a man who is the center of union are

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the royal hunts of ancient China it was customary to drive
			up the game from three sides, but on the fourth the animals had a
			chance to run off.&nbsp; If they failed to do this they had to pass
			through a gate behind which the king stood ready to shoot.&nbsp; Only
			animals that entered here were shot; those that ran off in front were
			permitted to escape.&nbsp; This custom accorded with a kingly
			attitude; the royal hunter did not wish to turn the chase into a
			slaughter, but held that the kill should consist only of those
			animals which had so to speak voluntarily exposed themselves.</p>
		<p>There is depicted here a ruler, or influential man, to whom
			people are attracted.&nbsp; Those who come to him he accepts, those
			who do not come are allowed to go their own way.&nbsp; He invited
			none, flatters none&mdash;all come of their own free will.&nbsp; In
			this way there develops a voluntary dependence among those who hold
			him.&nbsp; They do not have to be constantly on their guard but may
			express their opinions openly.&nbsp; Police measures are not
			necessary, and they cleave to their ruler of their own
			volition.&nbsp; The same principle of freedom is valid for life in
			general.&nbsp; We should not woo favor from people.&nbsp; If a man
			cultivates within himself the purity and the strength that are
			necessary for one who is the center of a fellowship, those who are
			meant for him come of their own accord.</p>

		<p>This hexagram means the force of the small&mdash;the power of

			in the fourth place, that of the minister, holds the five strong

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL<br /> Has success.<br /> Dense

		</p>
		<p>This image refers to the state of affairs in China at the time
			when King W&ecirc;n, who came originally from the west, was in the
			east at the court of the reigning tyrant Chou Hsin.&nbsp; The moment
			for action on a large scale had not yet arrived.&nbsp; King W&ecirc;n
			could only keep the tyrant somewhat in check by friendly
			persuasion.&nbsp; Hence the image of many clouds, promising moisture
			and blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls.&nbsp; The
			situation is not unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate
			success, but there are still obstacles in the way, and we can merely
			take preparatory measures.&nbsp; Only through the small means of
			friendly persuasion can we exert any influence.&nbsp; The time has
			not yet come for sweeping measures.&nbsp; However, we may be able, to
			a limited extent, to act as a restraining and subduing
			influence.&nbsp; To carry out our purpose we need firm determination
			within and gentleness and adaptability in external relations.</p>

		</p>
		<p>The wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet,
			being nothing but air, without solid body, it does not produce great

			refine the expression of his nature in small ways.</p>

		<p>It lies in the nature of a strong man to press forward.&nbsp;
			In so doing he encounters obstructions.&nbsp; Therefore he returns to
			the way suited to his situation, where he is free to advance or to

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>One would like to press forward, but before going farther one
			sees from the example of others like oneself that this way is
			blocked.&nbsp; In such a case, if the effort to push forward is not
			in harmony with the time, a reasonable and resolute man will not
			expose himself to a personal rebuff, but will retreat with others of
			like mind.&nbsp; This brings good fortune, because he does not

		<p>Here an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the
			consciousness that the obstructing power is slight.&nbsp; But since,
			under the circumstances, power actually lies with the weak, this
			sudden offensive is doomed to failure.&nbsp; External conditions
			hinder the advance, just as loss of the wheel spokes stops the
			progress of a wagon.&nbsp; We do not yet heed this hint from fate,
			hence there are annoying arguments like those of a married
			couple.&nbsp; Naturally this is not a favorable state of things, for
			though the situation may enable the weaker side to hold its ground,
			the difficulties are too numerous to permit of a happy result.&nbsp;
			In consequence even the strong man cannot so use his power as to
			exert the right influence on those around him.&nbsp; He experiences a
			rebuff where he expected an easy victory, and he thus compromises his
			dignity.</p>



		<ul class="constRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br /> If

		<p>If one is in the difficult and responsible position of

				character.<br /> Perseverance brings the woman into danger.<br />
				The moon is nearly full.<br /> If the superior man persists,<br />
				Misfortune comes.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Success is at hand.&nbsp; The wind has driven up the
			rain.&nbsp; A fixed standpoint has been reach.&nbsp; This has come
			about through the cumulation of small effects produced by reverence
			for a superior character.&nbsp; But a success thus secured bit by bit
			calls for great caution.&nbsp; It would be a dangerous illusion for
			anyone to think he could presume upon it.&nbsp; The female principle,
			the weak element that has won the victory, should never persist in
			vaunting it&mdash;that would lead to danger.&nbsp; The dark power in
			the moon is strongest when the moon is almost full.&nbsp; When it is
			full and directly opposite the sun, its waning is inevitable.&nbsp;
			Under such circumstances one must be content with what has been
			achieved.&nbsp; To advance any further, before the appropriate time
			has come, would lead to misfortune.</p>

			<img src="images/chien.gif" width="40" height="28"
				title="upper trigram for L&uuml;" alt="&#9776;" /><i>above</i>
			CH&rsquo;IEN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN <br />
			<img src="images/tui.gif" width="40" height="28"
				title="lower trigram for L&uuml;" alt="&#9777;" /><i>below </i>TUI
			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE JOYOUS, LAKE
		</p>
		<p>The name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of
			conducting oneself.&nbsp; Heaven, the father, is above, and the lake,
			the youngest daughter, is below.&nbsp; This shows the difference
			between high and low, upon which composure correct social conduct,
			depends.&nbsp; On the other hand, the word for the name of the
			hexagram, TREADING, means literally treading upon something.&nbsp;
			The small and cheerful [Tui] treads upon the large and strong
			[Ch&rsquo;ien].&nbsp; The direction of movement of the two primary
			trigrams is upward.&nbsp; The fact that the strong treads on the weak
			is not mentioned in the Book of Changes, because it is taken for
			granted.&nbsp; For the weak to take a stand against the strong is not
			dangerous here, because it happens in good humor [Tui] and without
			presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but takes it all
			in good part.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			TREADING.&nbsp; Treading upon the tail of the tiger.<br /> It does
			not bite the man.&nbsp; Success.<br />
		</p>
		<p>The situation is really difficult.&nbsp; That which is
			strongest and that which is weakest are close together.&nbsp; The
			weak follows behind the strong and worries it.&nbsp; The strong,
			however, acquiesces and does not hurt the weak, because the contact
			is in good humor and harmless.</p>
		<p>In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild,
			intractable people.&nbsp; In such a case one&rsquo;s purpose will be
			achieved if one behaves with decorum.&nbsp; Pleasant manners succeed
			even with irritable people.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			Heaven above, the lake below:<br /> The image of TREADING.<br />
			Thus the superior man discriminates between high and low,<br /> And
			thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.
		</p>
		<p>Heaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres
			in the natures of the two, hence no envy arises.&nbsp; Among mankind
			also there are necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible
			to bring about universal equality.&nbsp; But it is important that
			differences in social rank should not be arbitrary and unjust, for if
			this occurs, envy and class struggle are the inevitable
			consequences.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, external differences in
			rank correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner worth
			forms the criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order
			reigns in society.</p>


		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> Simple
				conduct.&nbsp; Progress without blame.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The situation is one in which we are still not bound by any
			obligations of social intercourse.&nbsp; If our conduct is simple, we
			remain free of them.&nbsp; We can quietly follow our predilections as
			long as we are content and make not demands on people.</p>
		<p>The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but
			progress.&nbsp; A man finds himself in an altogether inferior
			position at the start.&nbsp; However, he has the inner strength that
			guarantees progress.&nbsp; If he can be content with simplicity, he
			can make progress without blame.&nbsp; When a man is dissatisfied
			with modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to
			advance, not for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but
			merely in order to escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his
			conduct.&nbsp; Once his purpose is achieved, he is certain to become
			arrogant and luxury&ndash;loving.&nbsp; Therefore blame attaches to
			his progress.&nbsp; On the other hand, a man who is good at his work
			is content to behave simply.&nbsp; He wishes to make progress in
			order to accomplish something.&nbsp; When he attains his goal, he
			does something worth while, and all is well.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Treading a smooth, level course.<br /> The perseverance of a dark
				man<br /> Brings good fortune.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The situation of a lonely sage is indicated here.&nbsp; He
			remains withdrawn from the bustle of life, seeks nothing, asks
			nothing of anyone, and is not dazzled by enticing goals.&nbsp; He is
			true to himself and travels through life unassailed, on a level
			road.&nbsp; Since he is content and does not challenge fate, he
			remains free of entanglements.</p>



		<ul class="constRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> A
				one&ndash;eyed man is able to see,<br /> A lame man is able to
				tread.<br /> He treads on the tail of the tiger.<br /> The tiger
				bites the man.<br /> Misfortune.<br /> Thus does a warrior act on
				behalf of his great prince.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A one&ndash;eyed man can indeed see, but not enough for clear
			vision.&nbsp; A lame man can indeed tread, but not enough to make
			progress.&nbsp; If, in spite of such defects, a man considers himself
			strong and consequently exposes himself to danger, he is inviting
			disaster, for he is undertaking something beyond his strength.&nbsp;
			This reckless way of plunging ahead, regardless of the adequacy of
			one&rsquo;s powers, can be justified only in the case of a warrior
			battling for his prince.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br /> He
				treads on the tail of the tiger.<br /> Caution and circumspection<br />
				Lead ultimately to good fortune.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This text refers to a dangerous enterprise.&nbsp; The inner
			power to carry it through is there, but this inner power is combined
			with hesitating caution in one&rsquo;s external attitude.&nbsp; This
			line contrasts with the preceding line, which is weak within but
			outwardly presses forward.&nbsp; Here one is sure of ultimate
			success, which consists in achieving one&rsquo;s purpose, that is, in
			overcoming danger by going forward.</p>



		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br />
				Resolute conduct.<br /> Perseverance with awareness of danger.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This refers to the ruler of the hexagram as a whole.&nbsp; One
			sees that one has to be resolute in conduct.&nbsp; But at the same
			time one must remain conscious of the danger connected with such
			resoluteness, especially if it is to be persevered in.&nbsp; Only
			awareness of the danger makes success possible.</p>



		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> Look to your
				conduct and weigh the favorable signs.<br /> When everything is
				fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The work is ended.&nbsp; If we want to know whether good
			fortune will follow, we must look back upon our conduct and its
			consequences.&nbsp; If the effects are good, then good fortune is
			certain.&nbsp; No one knows himself.&nbsp; It is only by the
			consequences of his actions, by the fruit of his labors, that a man
			can judge what he is to expect.</p>
