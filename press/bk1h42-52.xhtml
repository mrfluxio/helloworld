<h2>42.&nbsp; I / Increase</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/sun.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for I" alt="&#9780;" /><i>above</i> SUN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE GENTLE, WIND
<br /><img src="images/chen.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for I" alt="&#9779;" /><i>below </i>CH&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE AROUSING, THUNDER
</p>
<p>
	The idea of increase is expressed in the fact that the strong lowest line of the upper trigram has sunk down and taken its place under the lower trigram.&nbsp;
	This conception also expresses the fundamental idea on which the Book of Changes is based.&nbsp;
	To rule truly is to serve.
</p>
<p>
	A sacrifice of the higher element that produces an increase of the lower is called an out&ndash;and&ndash;out increase: it indicates the spirit that alone has power to help the world.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	INCREASE.&nbsp; It furthers one<br />
	To undertake something.<br />
	It furthers one to cross the great water.
</p>
<p>
	Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below fills the people with a sense of joy and gratitude that is extremely valuable for the flowering of the commonwealth.&nbsp;
	When people are thus devoted to their leaders, undertakings are possible, and even difficult and dangerous enterprises will succeed.&nbsp;
	Therefore in such times of progress and successful development it is necessary to work and make the best use of time.&nbsp;
	This time resembles that of the marriage of heaven and earth, when the earth partakes of the creative power of heaven, forming and bringing forth living beings.&nbsp;
	The time of INCREASE does not endure, therefore it must be utilized while it lasts.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Wind and thunder: the image of INCREASE.<br />
	Thus the superior man:<br />
	If he sees good, he imitates it;<br />
	If he has faults, he rids himself of them.<br />
</p>
<p>
	While observing how thunder and wind increase and strengthen each other, a man can note the way to self&ndash;increase and self&ndash;improvement.&nbsp;
	When he discovers good in others, he should imitate it and thus make everything on earth his own.&nbsp;
	If he perceives something bad in himself, let him rid himself of it.&nbsp;
	In this way he becomes free of evil.&nbsp;
	This ethical change represents the most important increase of personality.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="constRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	It furthers one to accomplish great deeds.<br />
	Supreme good fortune.&nbsp; No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	If great help comes to a man from on high, this increased strength must be used to achieve something great for which he might otherwise never have found energy, or readiness to take responsibility.&nbsp;
	Great good fortune is produced by selflessness, and in bringing about great good fortune, he remains free of reproach.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	Someone does indeed increase him;<br />
	Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.<br />
	Constant perseverance brings good fortune.<br />
	The king presents him before God.<br />
	Good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A man brings about real increase by producing in himself the conditions for it, that is, through receptivity to and love of the good.&nbsp;
	Thus the thing for which he strives comes of itself, with the inevitability of natural law.&nbsp;
	Where increase is thus in harmony with the highest laws of the universe, it cannot be prevented by any constellation of accidents.&nbsp;
	But everything depends on his not letting unexpected good fortune make him heedless; he must make it his own through inner strength and steadfastness.&nbsp;
	Then he acquires meaning before God and man, and can accomplish something for the good of the world.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the third place means:<br />
	One is enriched through unfortunate events.<br />
	No blame, if you are sincere<br />
	And walk in the middle,<br />
	And report with a seal to the prince.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A time of blessing and enrichment has such powerful effects that even events ordinarily unfortunate must turn out to the advantage of those affected by them.&nbsp;
	These persons become free of error, and by acting in harmony with truth they gain such inner authority that they exert influence as if sanctioned by the letter and seal.
</p>



<ul class="constRuler">
<li>Six in the fourth place means:<br />
	If you walk in the middle<br />
	And report the prince,<br />
	He will follow.<br />
	It furthers one to be used<br />
	In the removal of the capital.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	It is important that there should be men who mediate between leaders and followers.&nbsp;
	These should be disinterested people, especially in times of increase, since the benefit is to spread from the leader to the people.&nbsp;
	Nothing of this benefit should be held back in a selfish way; it should really reach those for whom it is intended.&nbsp;
	This sort of intermediary, who also exercises a good influence on the leader, is especially important in times when it is a matter of great undertakings, decisive for the future and requiring the inner assent of all concerned.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not.<br />
	Supreme good fortune.<br />
	Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	True kindness does not count upon nor ask about merit and gratitude but acts from inner necessity.&nbsp;
	And such a truly kind heart finds itself rewarded in being recognized, and thus the beneficent influence will spread unhindered.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	He brings increase to no one.<br />
	Indeed, someone even strikes him.<br />
	He does not keep his heart constantly steady.<br />
	Misfortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The meaning here is that through renunciation those in high place should bring increase to those below.&nbsp;
	By neglecting this duty and helping no one, they in turn lose the furthering influence of others and soon find themselves alone.&nbsp;
	In this way they invite attacks.&nbsp;
	An attitude not permanently in harmony with the demands of the time will necessarily bring misfortune with it.&nbsp;
	Confucius says about this line:
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<span class="quote"><!-- open quote -->
	The superior man sets his person at rest before he moves; he composes his mind before he speaks; he makes his relations firm before he asks for something.&nbsp;
	By attending to these three matters, the superior man gains complete security.&nbsp;
	But if a man is brusque in his movements, others will not co&ndash;operate.&nbsp;
	If he is agitated in his words, they awaken no echo in others.&nbsp;
	If he asks for something without having first established relations, it will not be given to him.&nbsp;
	If no one is with him, those who would harm him draw near.

<h2>43.&nbsp; Kuai / Break-through (Resoluteness)</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/tui.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Kuai" alt="&#9777;" /><i>above</i> TUI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE JOYOUS, LAKE
<br /><img src="images/chien.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Kuai" alt="&#9776;" /><i>below </i>CH&rsquo;IEN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
</p>
<p>
	This hexagram signifies on the one hand a break&ndash;through after a long accumulation of tension, as a swollen river breaks through its dikes, or in the manner of a cloudburst.&nbsp;
	On the other hand, applied to human conditions, it refers to the time when inferior people gradually begin to disappear.&nbsp;
	Their influence is on the wane; as a result of resolute action, a change in conditions occurs, a break&ndash;through.&nbsp;
	The hexagram is linked with the third month [April&ndash;May].
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	BREAK&ndash;THROUGH.&nbsp; One must resolutely make the matter known<br />
	At the court of the king.<br />
	It must be announced truthfully.&nbsp; Danger.<br />
	It is necessary to notify one&rsquo;s own city.<br />
	It does not further to resort to arms.<br />
	It furthers one to undertake something.
</p>
<p>
	Even if only one inferior man is occupying a ruling position in a city, he is able to oppress superior men.&nbsp;
	Even a single passion still lurking in the heart has power to obscure reason.&nbsp;
	Passion and reason cannot exist side by side&mdash;therefore fight without quarter is necessary if the good is to prevail.
</p>
<p>
	In a resolute struggle of the good against evil, there are, however, definite rules that must not be disregarded, if it is to succeed.&nbsp;
	First, resolution must be based on a union of strength and friendliness.&nbsp;
	Second, a compromise with evil is not possible; evil must under all circumstances be openly discredited.&nbsp;
	Nor must our own passions and shortcomings be glossed over.&nbsp;
	Third, the struggle must not be carried on directly by force.&nbsp;
	If evil is branded, it thinks of weapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting against it blow for blow, we lose in the end because thus we ourselves get entangled in hatred and passion.&nbsp;
	Therefore it is important to begin at home, to be on guard in our own persons against the faults we have branded.&nbsp;
	In this way, finding no opponent, the sharp edges of the weapons of evil becomes dulled.&nbsp;
	For the same reasons we should not combat our own faults directly.&nbsp;
	As long as we wrestle with them, they continue victorious.&nbsp;
	Finally, the best way to fight evil is to make energetic progress in the good.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	The lake has risen up to heaven:<br />
	The image of BREAK&ndash;THROUGH.<br />
	Thus the superior man<br />
	Dispenses riches downward<br />
	And refrains from resting on his virtue.<br />
</p>
<p>
	When the water of a lake has risen up to heaven, there is reason to fear a cloudburst.&nbsp;
	Taking this as a warning, the superior man forestalls a violent collapse.&nbsp;
	If a man were to pile up riches for himself alone, without considering others, he would certainly experience a collapse.&nbsp;
	For all gathering is followed by dispersion.&nbsp;
	Therefore the superior man begins to distribute while he is accumulating.&nbsp;
	In the same way, in developing his character he takes care not to become hardened in obstinacy but to remain receptive to impressions by help of strict and continuous self&ndash;examination.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	Mighty in the forward&ndash;striding toes.<br />
	When one goes and is not equal to the task,<br />
	One makes a mistake.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In times of a resolute advance, the beginning is especially difficult.&nbsp;
	We feel inspired to press forward but resistance is still strong; therefore we ought to gauge our own strength and venture only so far as we can go with certainty of success.&nbsp;
	To plunge blindly ahead is wrong, because it is precisely at the beginning that an unexpected setback can have the most disastrous results.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	A cry of alarm.&nbsp; Arms at evening and at night.<br />
	Fear nothing.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Readiness is everything.&nbsp;
	Resolution is indissolubly bound up with caution.&nbsp;
	If an individual is careful and keeps his wits about him, he need not become excited or alarmed.&nbsp;
	If he is watchful at all times, even before danger is present, he is armed when danger approaches and need not be afraid.&nbsp;
	The superior man is on his guard against what is not yet in sight and on the alert for what is not yet within hearing; therefore he dwells in the midst of difficulties as though they did not exist.&nbsp;
	If a man develops his character, people submit to him of their own accord.&nbsp;
	If reason triumphs, the passions withdraw of themselves.&nbsp;
	To be circumspect and not to forget one&rsquo;s armor is the right way to security.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	To be powerful in the cheekbones<br />
	Brings misfortune.<br />
	The superior man is firmly resolved.<br />
	He walks alone and is caught in the rain.<br />
	He is bespattered,<br />
	And people murmur against him.<br />
	No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Here we have a man in an ambiguous situation.&nbsp;
	While all others are engaged in a resolute fight against all that is inferior, he alone has a certain relationship with an inferior man.&nbsp;
	If he were to show strength outwardly and turn against this man before the time is ripe, he would only endanger the entire situation, because the inferior man would too quickly have recourse to countermeasures.&nbsp;
	The task of the superior man becomes extremely difficult here.&nbsp;
	He must be firmly resolved within himself and, while maintaining association with the inferior man, avoid any participation in his vileness.&nbsp;
	He will of course be misjudged.&nbsp;
	It will be thought that he belongs to the party of the inferior man.&nbsp;
	He will be lonely because no one will understand him.&nbsp;
	His relations with the inferior man will sully him in the eyes of the multitude, and they will turn against him, grumbling.&nbsp;
	But he can endure this lack of appreciation and makes no mistake, because he remains true to himself.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	There is no skin on his thighs,<br />
	And walking comes hard.<br />
	If a man were to let himself be led like a sheep,<br />
	Remorse would disappear.<br />
	But if these words are heard<br />
	They will not be believed.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Here a man is suffering from inner restlessness and cannot abide in his place.&nbsp;
	He would like to push forward under any circumstances, but encounters insuperable obstacles.&nbsp;
	Thus his situation entails an inner conflict.&nbsp;
	This is due to the obstinacy with which he seeks to enforce his will.&nbsp;
	If he would desist from this obstinacy, everything would go well.&nbsp;
	But this advice, like so much other good counsel, will be ignored.&nbsp;
	For obstinacy makes a man unable to hear, for all that he has ears.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	In dealing with weeds,<br />
	Firm resolution is necessary.<br />
	Walking in the middle<br />
	Remains free of blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Weeds always grow back again and are difficult to exterminate.&nbsp;
	So too the struggle against an inferior man in a high position demands firm resolution.&nbsp;
	One has certain relations with him, hence there is danger that one may give up the struggle as hopeless.&nbsp;
	But this must not be.&nbsp;
	One must go on resolutely and not allow himself to be deflected from his course.&nbsp;
	Only in this way does one remain free of blame.
</p>



<ul class="constRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	No cry.<br />
	In the end misfortune comes.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Victory seems to have been achieved.&nbsp;
	There remains merely a remnant of the evil resolutely to be eradicated as the time demands.&nbsp;
	Everything looks easy.&nbsp;
	Just there, however, lies the danger.&nbsp;
	If we are not on guard, evil will succeed in escaping by means of concealment, and when it has eluded us new misfortunes will develop from the remaining seeds, for evil does not die easily.&nbsp;
	So too in dealing with the evil in one&rsquo;s own character, one must go to work with thoroughness.&nbsp;
	If out of carelessness anything were to be overlooked, new evil would arise from it.

<h2>44.&nbsp; Kou / Coming to Meet</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/chien.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Kou" alt="&#9776;" /><i>above</i> CH&rsquo;IEN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

</p>
<p>
	This hexagram indicates a situation in which the principle of darkness, after having been eliminated, furtively and unexpectedly obtrudes again from within and below.&nbsp;
	Of its own accord the female principle comes to meet the male.&nbsp;
	It is an unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must understand and promptly prevent the possible consequences.
</p>
<p>
	The hexagram is linked with the fifth month [June&ndash;July], because at the summer solstice the principle of darkness gradually becomes ascendant again.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	COMING TO MEET.&nbsp; The maiden is powerful.<br />
	One should not marry such a maiden.
</p>
<p>
	The rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the image of a bold girl who lightly surrenders herself and thus seizes power.&nbsp;
	This would not be possible if the strong and light&ndash;giving element had not in turn come halfway.&nbsp;
	The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a man delights in it; it looks so small and weak that he imagines he may dally with it and come to no harm.
</p>
<p>
	The inferior man rises only because the superior man does not regard him as dangerous and so lends him power.&nbsp;
	If he were resisted from the first, he could never gain influence.
</p>
<p>
	The time of COMING TO MEET is important in still another way.&nbsp;
	Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, there are times when this has great significance.&nbsp;
	When heaven and earth come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official come to meet each other, the world is put in order.&nbsp;
	It is necessary for elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another halfway.&nbsp;
	But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Under heaven, wind:<br />
	The image of COMING TO MEET.<br />

<p>
	The situation here resembles that in hexagram <a class="inlineRef" href="bk1h11-20.html#20">20, Kuan, CONTEMPLATION (VIEW)</a>.&nbsp;
	In the latter the wind blows over the earth, here it blows under heaven; in both cases it goes everywhere.&nbsp;
	There the wind is on the earth and symbolizes the ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom; here the wind blows from above and symbolizes the influence exercised by the ruler through his commands.&nbsp;
	Heaven is far from the things of earth, but it sets them in motion by means of the wind.&nbsp;
	The ruler is far from his people, but he sets them in motion by means of his commands and decrees.

	Perseverance brings good fortune.<br />
	If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.<br />
	Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	If an inferior element has wormed its way in, it must be energetically checked at once.&nbsp;
	By consistently checking it, bad effects can be avoided.&nbsp;
	If it is allowed to take its course, misfortune is bound to result; the insignificance of that which creeps in should not be a temptation to underrate it.&nbsp;
	A pig that is still young and lean cannot rage around much, but after it has eaten its fill and become strong, its true nature comes out if it has not previously been curbed.

	The inferior element is not overcome by violence but is kept under gentle control.&nbsp;
	Then nothing evil is to be feared.&nbsp;
	But care must be taken not to let it come in contact with those further away, because once free it would unfold its evil aspects unchecked.

<p>
	There is a temptation to fall in with the evil element offering itself&mdash;a very dangerous situation.&nbsp;
	Fortunately circumstances prevent this; one would like to do it, but cannot.&nbsp;
	This leads to painful indecision in behavior.&nbsp;
	But if we gain clear insight into the danger of the situation, we shall at least avoid more serious mistakes.

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	No fish in the tank.<br />

<p>

	Then we can make use of them if we should need them.&nbsp;

	But this is our own fault.

<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	A melon covered with willow leaves.<br />

<p>
	The melon, like the fish, is a symbol of the principle of darkness.&nbsp;
	It is sweet but spoils easily and for this reason is protected with a cover of willow leaves.&nbsp;
	This is a situation in which a strong, superior, well&ndash;poised man tolerates and protects the inferiors in his charge.&nbsp;
	He has the firm lines of order and beauty within himself but he does not lay stress upon them.&nbsp;
	He does not bother his subordinates with outward show or tiresome admonitions but leaves them quite free, putting his trust in the transforming power of a strong and upright personality.&nbsp;
	And behold!&nbsp;
	Fate is favorable.&nbsp;
	His inferiors respond to his influence and fall to his disposition like ripe fruit.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	He comes to meet with his horns.<br />
	Humiliation.&nbsp; No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	When a man has withdrawn from the world, its tumult often becomes unbearable to him.&nbsp;
	There are many people who in a noble pride hold themselves aloof from all that is low and rebuff it brusquely wherever it comes to meet them.&nbsp;
	Such persons are reproached for being proud and distant, but since active duties no longer hold them to the world, this does not greatly matter.&nbsp;
	They know how to bear the dislike of the masses with composure.

<h2>45.&nbsp; Ts&rsquo;ui / Gathering Together [Massing]</h2>

<p class="subTitle">

</p>
<p>
	This hexagram is related in form and meaning to <a class="inlineRef" href="bk1h1-10.html#8">Pi, HOLDING TOGETHER (8)</a>.&nbsp;
	In the latter, water is over the earth; here a lake is over the earth.&nbsp;
	But since the lake is a place where water collects, the idea of gathering together is even more strongly expressed here than in the other hexagram.&nbsp;
	The same idea also arises from the fact that in the present case it is two strong lines (the fourth and the fifth) that bring about the gathering together, whereas in the former case one strong line (the fifth) stands in the midst of weak lines.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	GATHERING TOGETHER.&nbsp; Success.<br />
	The king approaches his temple.<br />
	It furthers one to see the great man.<br />
	This brings success.&nbsp; Perseverance furthers.<br />
	To bring great offerings creates good fortune.<br />
	It furthers one to undertake something.
</p>
<p>
	The gathering together of people in large communities is either a natural occurrence, as in the case of the family, or an artificial one, as in the case of the state.&nbsp;
	The family gathers about the father as its head.&nbsp;
	The perpetuation of this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice to the ancestors, at which the whole clan is gathered together.&nbsp;
	Through the collective piety of the living members of the family, the ancestors become so integrated in the spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed or dissolved.
</p>
<p>
	Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are needed.&nbsp;
	But there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the group.&nbsp;
	In order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first of all be collected within himself.&nbsp;
	Only collective moral force can unite the world.&nbsp;
	Such great times of unification will leave great achievements behind them.&nbsp;
	This is the significance of the great offerings that are made.&nbsp;

	If the water in the lake gathers until it rises above the earth, there is danger of a break&ndash;through.&nbsp;
	Precautions must be taken to prevent this.&nbsp;
	Similarly where men gather together in great numbers, strife is likely to arise; where possessions are collected, robbery is likely to occur.&nbsp;
	Thus in the time of GATHERING TOGETHER we must arm promptly to ward off the unexpected.&nbsp;
	Human woes usually come as a result of unexpected events against which we are not forearmed.&nbsp;
	If we are prepared, they can be prevented.

<p>
	The situation is this: People desire to gather around a leader to whom they look up.&nbsp;
	But they are in a large group, by which they allow themselves to be influenced, so that they waver in their decision.&nbsp;
	Thus they lack a firm center around which to gather.&nbsp;
	But if expression is given to this need, and if they call for help, one grasp of the hand from the leader is enough to turn away all distress.&nbsp;

	In the time of GATHERING TOGETHER, we should make no arbitrary choice of the way.&nbsp;

	Often a man feels an urge to unite with others, but the individuals around him have already formed themselves into a group, so that he remains isolated.&nbsp;
	The whole situation proves untenable.&nbsp;
	Then he ought to choose the way of progress, resolutely allying himself with a man who stands nearer to the center of the group, and can help him to gain admission to the closed circle.&nbsp;

<h2>46.&nbsp; Sh&ecirc;ng / Pushing Upward</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/kun.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Sh&ecirc;ng" alt="&#9783;" /><i>above</i> K&rsquo;UN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
<br /><img src="images/sun.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Sh&ecirc;ng" alt="&#9780;" /><i>below </i>SUN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD
</p>
<p>
	The lower trigram, Sun, represents wood, and the upper, K&rsquo;un, means the earth.&nbsp;
	Linked with this is the idea that wood in the earth grows upward.&nbsp;
	In contrast to the meaning of <a class="inlineRef" href="bk1h31-41.html#35">Chin, PROGRESS (35)</a>, this pushing upward is associated with effort, just as a plant needs energy for pushing upward through the earth.&nbsp;
	That is why this hexagram, although it is connected with success, is associated with effort of the will.&nbsp;
	In PROGRESS the emphasis is on expansion; PUSHING UPWARD indicates rather a vertical ascent&mdash;direct rise from obscurity and lowliness to power and influence.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	PUSHING UPWARD has supreme success.<br />
	One must see the great man.<br />
	Fear not.<br />
	Departure toward the south<br />
	Brings good fortune.
</p>
<p>
	The pushing upward of the good elements encounters no obstruction and is therefore accompanied by great success.&nbsp;
	The pushing upward is made possible not by violence but by modesty and adaptability.&nbsp;
	Since the individual is borne along by the propitiousness of the time, he advances.&nbsp;
	He must go to see authoritative people.&nbsp;
	He need not be afraid to do this, because success is assured.&nbsp;
	But he must set to work, for activity (this is the meaning of &ldquo;the south&rdquo;) brings good fortune.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Within the earth, wood grows:<br />
	The image of PUSHING UPWARD.<br />
	Thus the superior man of devoted character<br />
	Heaps up small things<br />
	In order to achieve something high and great.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Adapting itself to obstacles and bending around them, wood in the earth grows upward without haste and without rest.&nbsp;
	Thus too the superior man is devoted in character and never pauses in his progress.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="constRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	Pushing upward that meets with confidence<br />
	Brings great good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This is the situation at the beginning of ascent.&nbsp;
	Just as wood draws strength for its upward push from the root, which in itself is in the lowest place, so the power to rise comes from this low and obscure station.&nbsp;
	But there is a spiritual affinity with the rulers above, and this solidarity creates the confidence needed to accomplish something.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	If one is sincere,<br />
	It furthers one to bring even a small offering.<br />
	No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Here a strong man is presupposed.&nbsp;
	It is true that he does not fit in with his environment, inasmuch as he is too brusque and pays too little attention to form.&nbsp;
	But as he is upright in character, he meets with response, and his lack of outward form does no harm.&nbsp;
	Here uprightness is the outcome of sound qualities of character, whereas in the corresponding line of the preceding hexagram it is the result of innate humility.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	One pushes upward into an empty city.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	All obstructions that generally block progress fall away here.&nbsp;
	Things proceed with remarkable ease.&nbsp;
	Unhesitatingly one follows this road, in order to profit by one&rsquo;s success.&nbsp;
	Seen from without, everything seems to be in the best of order.&nbsp;
	However, no promise of good fortune is added.&nbsp;
	It is a question how long such unobstructed success can last.&nbsp;
	But it is wise not to yield to such misgivings, because they only inhibit one&rsquo;s power.&nbsp;
	Instead, the point is to profit by the propitiousness of time.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fourth place means:<br />
	The king offers him Mount Ch&rsquo;i.<br />
	Good fortune.&nbsp; No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Mount Ch&rsquo;i is in western China, the homeland of King W&ecirc;n, whose son, the Duke of Chou, added the words to the individual lines.&nbsp;
	The pronouncement takes us back to a time when the Chou dynasty was coming into power.&nbsp;
	At that time King W&ecirc;n introduced his illustrious helpers to the god of his native mountain, and they received their places in the halls of the ancestors by the side of the ruler.&nbsp;
	This indicates a stage in which pushing upward attains its goal.&nbsp;
	One acquires fame in the sight of gods and men, is received into the circle of those who foster the spiritual life of the nation, and thereby attains a significance that endures beyond time.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Perseverance brings good fortune.<br />
	One pushes upward by steps.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	When a man is advancing farther and farther, it is important for him not to become intoxicated by success.&nbsp;
	Precisely when he experiences great success it is necessary to remain sober and not to try to skip any stages; he must go on slowly, step by step, as though hesitant.&nbsp;
	Only such calm, steady progress, overleaping nothing, leads to the goal.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	Pushing upward in darkness.<br />
	It furthers one<br />
	To be unremittingly persevering.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	He who pushes upward blindly deludes himself.&nbsp;
	He knows only advance, not retreat.&nbsp;
	But this means exhaustion.&nbsp;
	In such a case it is important to be constantly mindful that one must be conscientious and consistent and must remain so.&nbsp;
	Only thus does one become free of blind impulse, which is always harmful.

</p>
<p>
	The lake is above, water below; the lake is empty, dried up.&nbsp;
	Exhaustion is expressed in yet another way: at the top, a dark line is holding down two light lines; below, a light line is hemmed in between two dark ones.&nbsp;
	The upper trigram belongs to the principle of darkness, the lower to the principle of light.&nbsp;
	Thus everywhere superior men are oppressed and held in restraint by inferior men.

<p>
	Times of adversity are the reverse of times of success, but they can lead to success if they befall the right man.&nbsp;
	When a strong man meets with adversity, he remains cheerful despite all danger, and this cheerfulness is the source of later successes; it is that stability which is stronger than fate.&nbsp;
	He who lets his spirit be broken by exhaustion certainly has no success.&nbsp;
	But if adversity only bends a man, it creates in him a power to react that is bound in time to manifest itself.&nbsp;
	No inferior man is capable of this.&nbsp;
	Only the great man brings about good fortune and remains blameless.&nbsp;
	It is true that for the time being outward influence is denied him, because his words have no effect.&nbsp;
	Therefore in times of adversity it is important to be strong within and sparing of words.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>

<p>
	When the water has flowed out below, the lake must dry up and become exhausted.&nbsp;
	That is fate.&nbsp;
	This symbolizes an adverse fate in human life.&nbsp;
	In such times there is nothing a man can do but acquiesce in his fate and remain true to himself.&nbsp;
	This concerns the deepest stratum of his being, for this alone is superior to all external fate.

<p>
	When adversity befalls a man, it is important above all things for him to be strong and to overcome the trouble inwardly.&nbsp;
	If he is weak, the trouble overwhelms him.&nbsp;
	Instead of proceeding on his way, he remains sitting under a bare tree and falls ever more deeply into gloom and melancholy.&nbsp;

<p>
	This pictures a state of inner oppression.&nbsp;
	Externally, all is well, one has meat and drink.&nbsp;
	But one is exhausted by the commonplaces of life, and there seems to be no way of escape.&nbsp;
	Then help comes from a high place.&nbsp;
	A prince&mdash;in ancient China princes wore scarlet knee bands&mdash;is in search of able helpers.&nbsp;
	But there are still obstructions to be overcome.&nbsp;
	Therefore it is important to meet these obstructions in the invisible realm by offerings and prayer.&nbsp;
	To set forth without being prepared would be disastrous, though not morally wrong.&nbsp;
	Here a disagreeable situation must be overcome by patience of spirit.

<p>
	This shows a man who is restless and indecisive in times of adversity.&nbsp;
	At first he wants to push ahead, then he encounters obstructions that, it is true, mean oppression only when recklessly dealt with.&nbsp;
	He butts his head against a wall and in consequence feels himself oppressed by the wall.&nbsp;
	Then he leans on things that have in themselves no stability and that are merely a hazard for him who leans on them.&nbsp;
	Thereupon he turns back irresolutely and retires into his house, only to find, as a fresh disappointment, that his wife is not there.&nbsp;
	Confucius says about this line:
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<span class="quote"><!-- open quote -->
	If a man permits himself to be oppressed by something that ought not to oppress him, his name will certainly be disgraced.&nbsp;

	An individual who has the good of mankind at heart is oppressed from above and below (this is the meaning of the cutting off of nose and feet).&nbsp;

<h2>48.&nbsp; Ching / The Well</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/kan.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Ching" alt="&#9781;" /><i>above</i> K&rsquo;AN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE ABYSMAL, WATER
<br /><img src="images/sun.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Ching" alt="&#9780;" /><i>below </i>SUN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD
</p>
<p>
	Wood is below, water above.&nbsp;
	The wood goes down into the earth to bring up water.&nbsp;
	The image derives from the pole&ndash;and&ndash;bucket well of ancient China.&nbsp;
	The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were made of clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled up from the well.&nbsp;
	The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift water out of the earth by means of their fibers.
</p>
<p>
	The well from which water is drawn conveys the further idea of an inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	THE WELL.&nbsp; The town may be changed,<br />
	But the well cannot be changed.<br />
	It neither decreases nor increases.<br />
	They come and go and draw from the well.<br />
	If one gets down almost to the water<br />
	And the rope does not go all the way,<br />
	Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.
</p>
<p>
	In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for the sake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties.&nbsp;
	The style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of the well has remained the same from ancient times to this day.&nbsp;
	Thus the well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms.&nbsp;
	Political structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remains eternally the same&mdash;this cannot be changed.&nbsp;
	Life is also inexhaustible.&nbsp;
	It grows neither less nor more; it exists for one and for all.&nbsp;
	The generations come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance.
</p>
<p>
	However, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social organization of mankind.&nbsp;
	We must go down to the very foundations of life.&nbsp;
	For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs unsatisfied is as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made.&nbsp;
	Carelessness&mdash;by which the jug is broken&mdash;is also disastrous.&nbsp;
	If for instance the military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug.
</p>
<p>
	This hexagram applies also to the individual.&nbsp;
	However men may differ in disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same in everyone.&nbsp;
	And every human being can draw in the course of his education from the inexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp;
	But here likewise two dangers threaten: a man may fail in his education to penetrate to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention&mdash;a partial education of this sort is as bad as none&mdash;or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self&ndash;development.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Water over wood: the image of THE WELL.<br />
	Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,<br />
	And exhorts them to help one another.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K&rsquo;an, water, is above it.&nbsp;
	Wood sucks water upward.&nbsp;
	Just as wood as an organism imitates the action of the well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior man organizes human society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts co&ndash;operate for the benefit of the whole.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	One does not drink the mud of the well.<br />
	No animals come to an old well.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	If a man wanders around in swampy lowlands, his life is submerged in mud.&nbsp;
	Such a man loses all significance for mankind.&nbsp;
	He who throws himself away is no longer sought out by others.&nbsp;
	In the end no one troubles about him any more.

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	At the wellhole one shoots fishes.<br />
	The jug is broken and leaks.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The water itself is clear, but it is not being used.&nbsp;
	Thus the well is a place where only fish will stay, and whoever comes to it, comes only to catch fish.&nbsp;
	But the jug is broken, so that the fish cannot be kept in it.
<br /><br />
	This describes the situation of a person who possesses good qualities but neglects them.&nbsp;
	No one bothers about him.&nbsp;
	As a result he deteriorates in mind.&nbsp;
	He associates with inferior men and can no longer accomplish anything worth while.
</p>

	Good fortune might be enjoyed in common.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	An able man is available.&nbsp;
	He is like a purified well whose water is drinkable.&nbsp;
	But no use is made of him.&nbsp;
	This is the sorrow of those who know him.&nbsp;
	One wishes that the prince might learn about it; this would be good fortune for all concerned.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fourth place means:<br />
	The well is being lined.&nbsp; No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	True, if a well is being lined with stone, it cannot be used while the work is going on.&nbsp;
	But the work is not in vain; the result is that the water stays clear.&nbsp;
	In life also there are times when a man must put himself in order.&nbsp;
	During such a time he can do nothing for others, but his work is nonetheless valuable, because by enhancing his powers and abilities through inner development, he can accomplish all the more later on.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	In the well there is a clear, cold spring<br />
	From which one can drink.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A well that is fed by a spring of living water is a good well.&nbsp;
	A man who has virtues like a well of this sort is born to be a leader and savior of men, for he has the water of life.&nbsp;
	Nevertheless, the character for "good fortune" is left out here.&nbsp;
	The all&ndash;important thing about a well is that its water be drawn.&nbsp;
	The best water is only a potentiality for refreshment as long as it is not brought up.&nbsp;
	So too with leaders of mankind: it is all&ndash;important that one should drink from the spring of their words and translate them into life.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	One draws from the well<br />
	Without hindrance.<br />
	It is dependable.<br />
	Supreme good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The well is there for all.&nbsp;
	No one is forbidden to take water from it.&nbsp;
	No matter how many come, all find what they need, for the well is dependable.&nbsp;
	It has a spring and never runs dry.&nbsp;
	Therefore it is a great blessing to the whole land.&nbsp;
	The same is true of the really great man, whose inner wealth is inexhaustible; the more that people draw from him, the greater his wealth becomes.

<h2>49.&nbsp; Ko / Revolution (Molting)</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/tui.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Ko" alt="&#9777;" /><i>above</i> TUI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE JOYOUS, LAKE
<br /><img src="images/li.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Ko" alt="&#9778;" /><i>below </i>LI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CLINGING, FIRE
</p>
<p>
	The Chinese character for this hexagram means in its original sense an animal&rsquo;s pelt, which is changed in the course of the year by molting.&nbsp;
	From this the word is carried over to apply to the &ldquo;moltings&rdquo; in political life, the great revolutions connected with changes of governments.
</p>
<p>
	The two trigrams making up the hexagram are the same two that appear in <a class="inlineRef" href="bk1h31-41.html#38">K&rsquo;uei, OPPOSITION (38)</a>, that is, the two younger daughters, Li and Tui.&nbsp;
	But while there the elder of the two daughters is above, and what results is essentially only an opposition of tendencies, here the younger daughter is above.&nbsp;
	The influences are in actual conflict, and the forces combat each other like fire and water (lake), each trying to destroy the other.&nbsp;
	Hence the idea of revolution.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	REVOLUTION.&nbsp; On your own day<br />
	You are believed.<br />
	Supreme success,<br />
	Furthering through perseverance.<br />
	Remorse disappears.
</p>
<p>
	Political revolutions are extremely grave matters.&nbsp;
	They should be undertaken only under stress of direst necessity, when there is no other way out.&nbsp;
	Not everyone is called to this task, but only the man who has the confidence of the people, and even he only when the time is ripe.&nbsp;
	He must then proceed in the right way, so that he gladdens the people and, by enlightening them, prevents excesses.&nbsp;
	Furthermore, he must be quite free of selfish aims and must really relieve the need of the people.&nbsp;
	Only then does he have nothing to regret.
</p>
<p>
	Times change, and with them their demands.&nbsp;
	Thus the seasons change in the course of the year.&nbsp;
	In the world cycle also there are spring and autumn in the life of peoples and nations, and these call for social transformations.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Fire in the lake: the image of REVOLUTION.<br />
	Thus the superior man<br />
	Sets the calendar in order<br />
	And makes the seasons clear.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Fire below and the lake above combat and destroy each other.&nbsp;
	So too in the course of the year a combat takes place between the forces of light and the forces of darkness, eventuating in the revolution of the seasons.&nbsp;
	Man masters these changes in nature by noting their regularity and marking off the passage of time accordingly.&nbsp;
	In this way order and clarity appear in the apparently chaotic changes of the seasons, and man is able to adjust himself in advance to the demands of the different times.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	Wrapped in the hide of a yellow cow.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Changes ought to be undertaken only when there is nothing else to be done.&nbsp;
	Therefore at first the utmost restraint is necessary.&nbsp;
	One must become firm in one&rsquo;s mind, control oneself&mdash;yellow is the color of the mean, and the cow is the symbol of docility&mdash;and refrain from doing anything for the time being, because any premature offensive will bring evil results.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	When one&rsquo;s own day comes, one may create revolution.<br />
	Starting brings good fortune.&nbsp; No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	When we have tried in every way to bring about reforms, but without success, revolution becomes necessary.&nbsp;
	But such a thoroughgoing upheaval must be carefully prepared.&nbsp;
	There must be available a man who has the requisite abilities and who possesses public confidence.&nbsp;
	To such a man we may well turn.&nbsp;
	This brings good fortune and is not a mistake.&nbsp;
	The first thing to be considered is our inner attitude toward the new condition that will inevitably come.&nbsp;
	We have to go out to meet it, as it were.&nbsp;
	Only in this way can it be prepared for.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	Starting brings misfortune.<br />
	Perseverance brings danger.<br />
	When talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times,<br />
	One may commit himself,<br />
	And men will believe him.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	When change is necessary, there are two mistakes to be avoided.&nbsp;
	One lies in excessive haste and ruthlessness, which bring disaster.&nbsp;
	The other lies in excessive hesitation and conservatism, which are also dangerous.&nbsp;
	Not every demand for change in the existing order should be heeded.&nbsp;
	On the other hand, repeated and well&ndash;founded complaints should not fail of a hearing.&nbsp;
	When talk of change has come to one&rsquo;s ears three times, and has been pondered well, he may believe and acquiesce in it.&nbsp;
	Then he will meet with belief and will accomplish something.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Remorse disappears.&nbsp; Men believe him.<br />
	Changing the form of government brings good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Radical changes require adequate authority.&nbsp;
	A man must have inner strength as well as influential position.&nbsp;
	What he does must correspond with a higher truth and must not spring from arbitrary or petty motives; then it brings great good fortune.&nbsp;
	If a revolution is not founded on such inner truth, the results are bad, and it has no success.&nbsp;
	For in the end men will support only those undertakings which they feel instinctively to be just.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	The great man changes like a tiger.<br />
	Even before he questions the oracle<br />
	He is believed.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A tigerskin, with its highly visible black stripes on a yellow ground, shows its distinct pattern from afar.&nbsp;
	It is the same with a revolution brought about by a great man: large, clear guiding lines become visible, understandable to everyone.&nbsp;
	Therefore he need not first consult the oracle, for he wins the spontaneous support of the people.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	The superior man changes like a panther.<br />
	The inferior man molts in the face.<br />
	Starting brings misfortune.<br />
	To remain persevering brings good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	After the large and fundamental problems are settled, certain minor reforms, and elaborations of these, are necessary.&nbsp;
	These detailed reforms may be likened to the equally distinct but relatively small marks of the panther&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp;
	As a consequence, a change also takes place among the inferior people.&nbsp;
	In conformity with the new order, they likewise "molt."&nbsp;
	This molting, it is true, does not go very deep, but that is not to be expected.&nbsp;
	We must be satisfied with the attainable.&nbsp;
	If we should go too far and try to achieve too much, it would lead to unrest and misfortune.&nbsp;
	For the object of a great revolution is the attainment of clarified, secure conditions ensuring a general stabilization on the basis of what is possible at the moment.

<h2>50.&nbsp; Ting / The Caldron</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/li.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Ting" alt="&#9778;" /><i>above</i> LI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CLINGING, FIRE
<br /><img src="images/sun.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Ting" alt="&#9780;" /><i>below </i>SUN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD
</p>
<p>
	The six lines construct the image of Ting, THE CALDRON; at the bottom are the legs, over them the belly, then come the ears (handles), and at the top the carrying rings.&nbsp;
	At the same time, the image suggests the idea of nourishment.&nbsp;
	The <i>ting</i>, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held the cooked viands in the temple of the ancestors and at banquets.&nbsp;
	The heads of the family served the food from the <i>ting</i> into the bowls of the guests.
</p>
<p>
	<a class="inlineRef" href="#48">THE WELL (48)</a> likewise has the secondary meaning of giving nourishment, but rather more in relation to the people.&nbsp;
	The <i>ting</i>, as a utensil pertaining to a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men, which redounded to the benefit of the state.
</p>
<p>
	This hexagram and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that represent concrete, man&ndash;made objects.&nbsp;
	Yet here too the thought has its abstract connotation.
</p>
<p>
	Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame.&nbsp;
	Thus together they stand for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea of preparing food.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	THE CALDRON.&nbsp; Supreme good fortune.<br />
	Success.
</p>
<p>
	While THE WELL relates to the social foundation of our life, and this foundation is likened to the water that serves to nourish growing wood, the present hexagram refers to the cultural superstructure of society.&nbsp;
	Here it is the wood that serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit.&nbsp;
	All that is visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the invisible.&nbsp;
	Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes firm root in the cosmic order.
</p>
<p>
	Here we see civilization as it reaches its culmination in religion.&nbsp;
	The <i>ting</i> serves in offering sacrifice to God.&nbsp;
	The highest earthly values must be sacrificed to the divine.&nbsp;
	But the truly divine does not manifest itself apart from man.&nbsp;
	The supreme revelation of God appears in prophets and holy men.&nbsp;
	To venerate them is true veneration of God.&nbsp;
	The will of God, as revealed through them, should be accepted in humility; this brings inner enlightenment and true understanding of the world, and this leads to great good fortune and success.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Fire over wood:<br />
	The image of THE CALDRON.<br />
	Thus the superior man consolidates his fate<br />
	By making his position correct.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The fate of fire depends on wood; as long as there is wood below, the fire burns above.&nbsp;
	It is the same in human life; there is in man likewise a fate that lends power to his life.&nbsp;
	And if he succeeds in assigning the right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts his fate on a firm footing.&nbsp;
	These words contain hints about fostering of life as handed on by oral tradition in the secret teachings of Chinese yoga.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	A <i>ting</i> with legs upturned.<br />
	Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.<br />
	One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.<br />
	No blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	If a <i>ting</i> is turned upside down before being used, no harm is done&mdash;on the contrary, this clears it of refuse.&nbsp;
	A concubine&rsquo;s position is lowly, but because she has a son she comes to be honored.
<br /><br />
	These two metaphors express the idea that in a highly developed civilization, such as that indicated by this hexagram, every person of good will can in some way or other succeed.&nbsp;
	No matter how lowly he may be, provided he is ready to purify himself, he is accepted.&nbsp;
	He attains a station in which he can prove himself fruitful in accomplishment, and as a result he gains recognition.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	There is food in the <i>ting</i>.<br />
	My comrades are envious,<br />
	But they cannot harm me.<br />
	Good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In a period of advanced culture, it is of the greatest importance that one should achieve something significant.&nbsp;
	If a man concentrates on such real undertakings, he may indeed experience envy and disfavor, but that is not dangerous.&nbsp;
	The more he limits himself to his actual achievements, the less harm the envious inflict on him.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	The handle of the <i>ting</i> is altered.<br />
	One is impeded in his way of life.<br />
	The fat of the pheasant is not eaten.<br />
	Once rain falls, remorse is spent.<br />
	Good fortune comes in the end.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The handle is the means for lifting up the <i>ting</i>.&nbsp;
	If the handle is altered, the <i>ting</i> cannot be lifted up and used, and, sad to say, the delicious food in it, such as pheasant fat, cannot be eaten by anyone.
<br /><br />
	This describes a man who, in a highly evolved civilization, finds himself in a place where no one notices or recognizes him.&nbsp;
	This is a severe block to his effectiveness.&nbsp;
	All of his good qualities and gifts of mind thus needlessly go to waste.&nbsp;
	But if he will only see to it that he is possessed of something truly spiritual, the time is bound to come, sooner or later, when the difficulties will be resolved and all will go well.&nbsp;
	The fall of rain symbolizes here, as in other instances, release of tension.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	The legs of the <i>ting</i> are broken.<br />
	The prince&rsquo;s meal is spilled<br />
	And his person is soiled.<br />
	Misfortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A man has a difficult and responsible task to which he is not adequate.&nbsp;
	Moreover, he does not devote himself to it with all his strength but goes about with inferior people; therefore the execution of the work fails.&nbsp;
	In this way he also incurs personal opprobrium.
<br /><br />
	Confucius says about this line: "Weak character coupled with honored place, meager knowledge with large plans, limited powers with heavy responsibility, will seldom escape disaster."
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	The <i>ting</i> has yellow handles, golden carrying rings.<br />
	Perseverance furthers.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Here we have, in a ruling position, a man who is approachable and modest in nature.&nbsp;
	As a result of this attitude he succeeds in finding strong and able helpers who complement and aid him in his work.&nbsp;
	Having achieved this attitude, which requires constant self&ndash;abnegation, it is important for him to hold to it and not to let himself be led astray.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	The <i>ting</i> has rings of jade.<br />
	Great good fortune.<br />
	Nothing that would not act to further.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In the preceding line the carrying rings are described as golden, to denote their strength; here they are said to be of jade.&nbsp;
	Jade is notable for its combination of hardness with soft luster.&nbsp;
	This counsel, in relation to the man who is open to it, works greatly to his advantage.&nbsp;
	Here the counsel is described in relation to the sage who imparts it.&nbsp;
	In imparting it, he will be mild and pure, like precious jade.&nbsp;
	Thus the work finds favor in the eyes of the Deity, who dispenses great good fortune, and becomes pleasing to men, wherefore all goes well.

<h2>51.&nbsp; Ch&ecirc;n / The Arousing (Shock, Thunder)</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/chen.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Ch&ecirc;n" alt="&#9779;" /><i>above</i> CH&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE AROUSING, THUNDER
<br /><img src="images/chen.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Ch&ecirc;n" alt="&#9779;" /><i>below </i>CH&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE AROUSING, THUNDER
</p>
<p>
	The hexagram Ch&ecirc;n represents the eldest son, who seizes rule with energy and power.&nbsp;
	A yang line develops below two yin lines and presses upward forcibly.&nbsp;
	This movement is so violent that it arouses terror.&nbsp;
	It is symbolized by thunder, which bursts forth from the earth and by its shock causes fear and trembling.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	SHOCK brings success.<br />
	Shock comes&mdash;oh, oh!<br />
	Laughing words&mdash;ha, ha!<br />
	The shock terrifies for a hundred miles,<br />
	And he does not let fall the sacrificial spoon and chalice.
</p>
<p>
	The shock that comes from the manifestation of God within the depths of the earth makes man afraid, but this fear of God is good, for joy and merriment can follow upon it.
</p>
<p>
	When a man has learned within his heart what fear and trembling mean, he is safeguarded against any terror produced by outside influences.&nbsp;
	Let the thunder roll and spread terror a hundred miles around: he remains so composed and reverent in spirit that the sacrificial rite is not interrupted.&nbsp;
	This is the spirit that must animate leaders and rulers of men&mdash;a profound inner seriousness from which all terrors glance off harmlessly.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Thunder repeated: the image of SHOCK.<br />
	Thus in fear and trembling<br />
	The superior man sets his life in order<br />
	And examines himself.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The shock of continuing thunder brings fear and trembling.&nbsp;
	The superior man is always filled with reverence at the manifestation of God; he sets his life in order and searches his heart, lest it harbor any secret opposition to the will of God.&nbsp;
	Thus reverence is the foundation of true culture.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	Shock comes&mdash;oh, oh!<br />
	Then follow laughing words&mdash;ha, ha!<br />
	Good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The fear and trembling engendered by shock come to an individual at first in such a way that he sees himself placed at a disadvantage as against others.&nbsp;
	But this is only transitory.&nbsp;
	When the ordeal is over, he experiences relief, and thus the very terror he had to endure at the outset brings good fortune in the long run.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	Shock comes bringing danger.<br />
	A hundred thousand times<br />
	You lose your treasures<br />
	And must climb the nine hills.<br />
	Do not go in pursuit of them.<br />
	After seven days you will get them back again.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This pictures a situation in which a shock endangers a man and he suffers great losses.&nbsp;
	Resistance would be contrary to the movement of the time and for this reason unsuccessful.&nbsp;
	Therefore he must simply retreat to heights inaccessible to the threatening forces of danger.&nbsp;
	He must accept his loss of property without worrying too much about it.&nbsp;
	When the time of shock and upheaval that has robbed him of his possessions has passed, he will get them back again without going in pursuit of them.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the third place means:<br />
	Shock comes and makes one distraught.<br />
	If shock spurs to action<br />
	One remains free of misfortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	There are three kinds of shock&mdash;the shock of heaven, which is thunder, the shock of fate, and, finally, the shock of the heart.&nbsp;
	The present hexagram refers less to inner shock than to the shock of fate.&nbsp;
	In such times of shock, presence of mind is all too easily lost: the individual overlooks all opportunities for action and mutely lets fate take its course.&nbsp;
	But if he allows the shocks of fate to induce movement within his mind, he will overcome these external blows with little effort.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Shock is mired.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Movement within the mind depends for its success partly on circumstances.&nbsp;
	If there is neither a resistance that might be vigorously combated, nor yet a yielding that permits of victory&mdash;if, instead, everything is tough and inert like mire&mdash;movement is crippled.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Shock goes hither and thither.<br />
	Danger.<br />
	However, nothing at all is lost.<br />
	Yet there are things to be done.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This is a case not of a single shock but of repeated shocks with no breathing space between.&nbsp;
	Nonetheless, the shock causes no loss, because one takes care to stay in the center of movement and in this way to be spared the fate of being helplessly tossed hither and thither.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing around.<br />
	Going ahead brings misfortune.<br />
	If it has not yet touched one&rsquo;s own body<br />
	But has reached one&rsquo;s neighbor first,<br />
	There is no blame.<br />
	One&rsquo;s comrades have something to talk about.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	When inner shock is at its height, it robs a man of reflection and clarity of vision.&nbsp;
	In such a state of shock it is of course impossible to act with presence of mind.&nbsp;
	Then the right thing is to keep still until composure and clarity are restored.&nbsp;
	But this a man can do only when he himself is not yet infected by the agitation, although its disastrous effects are already visible in those around him.&nbsp;
	If he withdraws from the affair in time, he remains free of mistakes and injury.&nbsp;
	But his comrades, who no longer heed any warning, will in their excitement certainly be displeased with him.&nbsp;
	However, he must not take this into account.

<h2>52.&nbsp; K&ecirc;n / Keeping Still, Mountain</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/ken.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for K&ecirc;n" alt="&#9782;" /><i>above</i> K&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
<br /><img src="images/ken.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for K&ecirc;n" alt="&#9782;" /><i>below </i>K&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
</p>
<p>
	The image of this hexagram is the mountain, the youngest son of heaven and earth.&nbsp;
	The male principle is at the top because it strives upward by nature; the female principle is below, since the direction of its movement is downward.&nbsp;
	Thus there is rest because the movement has come to its normal end.
</p>
<p>
	In its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the problem of achieving a quiet heart.&nbsp;
	It is very difficult to bring quiet to the heart.&nbsp;
	While Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing away of all movement in nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polarity that always posits movement as its complement.&nbsp;
	Possibly the words of the text embody directions for the practice of yoga.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	KEEPING STILL.&nbsp; Keeping his back still<br />
	So that he no longer feels his body.<br />
	He goes into his courtyard<br />
	And does not see his people.<br />
	No blame.<br />
</p>
<p>
	True quiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep still, and going forward when the time has come to go forward.&nbsp;
	In this way rest and movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there is light in life.
</p>
<p>
	The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement.&nbsp;
	The back is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibers that mediate movement.&nbsp;
	If the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a standstill, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as it were.&nbsp;
	When a man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world.&nbsp;
	He no longer sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and therefore he has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding the great laws of the universe and for acting in harmony with them.&nbsp;
	Whoever acts from these deep levels makes no mistakes.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">

	To go beyond his situation.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The heart thinks constantly.&nbsp;
	This cannot be changed, but the movements of the heart&mdash;that is, a man&rsquo;s thoughts&mdash;should restrict themselves to the immediate situation.&nbsp;
	All thinking that goes beyond this only makes the heart sore.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	Keeping his toes still.<br />
	No blame.<br />
	Continued perseverance furthers.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Keeping the toes still means halting before one has even begun to move.&nbsp;
	The beginning is the time of few mistakes.&nbsp;
	At that time one is still in harmony with primal innocence.&nbsp;
	Not yet influenced by obscuring interests and desires, one sees things intuitively as they really are.&nbsp;
	A man who halts at the beginning, so long as he has not yet abandoned truth, finds the right way.&nbsp;
	But persisting firmness is needed to keep one from drifting irresolutely.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">

	He cannot rescue him whom he follows.<br />
	His heart is not glad.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The leg cannot move independently; it depends on the movement of the body.&nbsp;
	If a leg is suddenly stopped while the whole body is in vigorous motion, the continuing body movement will make one fall. <br /><br /> The same is true of a man who serves a master stronger than himself.&nbsp;
	He is swept along, and even though he may himself halt on the path of wrongdoing, he can no longer check the other in his powerful movement.&nbsp;
	Where the master presses forward, the servant, no matter how good his intentions, cannot save him.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	Keeping his hips still.<br />

	Dangerous.&nbsp; The heart suffocates.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This refers to enforced quiet.&nbsp;
	The restless heart is to be subdued by forcible means.&nbsp;
	But fire when it is smothered changes into acrid smoke that suffocates as it spreads.
<br /><br />
	Therefore, in exercises in meditation and concentration, one ought not to try to force results.&nbsp;
	Rather, calmness must develop naturally out of a state of inner composure.&nbsp;
	If one tries to induce calmness by means of artificial rigidity, meditation will lead to very unwholesome results.

<p>
	As has been pointed out above in the comment on the Judgment, keeping the back at rest means forgetting the ego.&nbsp;
	This is the highest stage of rest.&nbsp;
	Here this stage has not yet been reached: the individual in this instance, though able to keep the ego, with its thoughts and impulses, in a state of rest, is not yet quite liberated from its dominance.&nbsp;
	Nonetheless, keeping the heart at rest is an important function, leading in the end to the complete elimination of egotistic drives.&nbsp;
	Even though at this point one does not yet remain free from all the dangers of doubt and unrest, this frame of mind is not a mistake, as it leads ultimately to that other, higher level.

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Keeping his jaws still.<br />
	The words have order.<br />
	Remorse disappears.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A man in a dangerous situation, especially when he is not adequate to it, is inclined to be very free with talk and presumptuous jokes.&nbsp;
	But injudicious speech easily leads to situations that subsequently give much cause for regret.&nbsp;
	However, if a man is reserved in speech, his words take ever more definite form, and every occasion for regret vanishes.

<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	Noblehearted keeping still.<br />
	Good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This marks the consummation of the effort to attain tranquillity.&nbsp;
	One is at rest, not merely in a small, circumscribed way in regard to matters of detail, but one has also a general resignation in regard to life as a whole, and this confers peace and good fortune in relation to every individual matter.
