<h2>21.&nbsp; Shih Ho / Biting Through</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/li.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Shih Ho" alt="&#9778;" /><i>above</i> LI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CLINGING, FIRE
<br /><img src="images/chen.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Shih Ho" alt="&#9779;" /><i>below</i>CH&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE AROUSING, THUNDER
</p>
<p>
	This hexagram represents an open mouth (<a class="inlineRef" href="#27">cf. hexagram 27</a>) with an obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth.&nbsp;
	As a result the lips cannot meet.&nbsp;
	To bring them together one must bite energetically through the obstacle.&nbsp;
	Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature.&nbsp;
	Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing tension in nature.&nbsp;
	Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers.&nbsp;
	The theme of this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of <a class="inlineRef" href="bk1h1-10.html#6">Sung,
	CONFLICT (6)</a>, which refers to civil suits.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	BITING THROUGH has success.<br />
	It is favorable to let justice be administered.<br />
</p>
<p>
	When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success.&nbsp;
	This is true in all situations.&nbsp;
	Whenever unity cannot be established, the obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking
	the way.&nbsp;
	To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at once.&nbsp;
	Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord.&nbsp;
	Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.
</p>
<p>
	However, it is important to proceed in the right way.&nbsp;
	The hexagram combines Li, clarity, and Ch&ecirc;n, excitement.&nbsp;
	Li is yielding, Ch&ecirc;n is hard.&nbsp;
	Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak.&nbsp;
	The two together create the just measure.&nbsp;
	It is of moment that the man who makes the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he commands respect by his conduct in his position.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Thunder and lighting:<br />
	The image of BITING THROUGH.<br />
	Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws<br />
	Through clearly defined penalties.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Penalties are the individual applications of the law.&nbsp;
	The laws specify the penalties.&nbsp;
	Clarity prevails when mild and severe penalties are differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes.&nbsp;
	This is symbolized by the clarity of lightning.&nbsp;
	The law is strengthened by a just application of penalties.&nbsp;
	This is symbolized by the terror of thunder.&nbsp;
	This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling respect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves.&nbsp;
	The obstructions in the social life of man increase when there is a 	lack of clarity in the penal codes and slackness in executing them.&nbsp;
	The only way to strengthen the law is to make it clear and to make penalties certain and swift.

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	His feet are fastened in the stocks,<br />
	So that his toes disappear.<br />
	No blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	If a sentence is imposed the first time a man attempts to do wrong, the penalty is a mild one.&nbsp;
	Only the toes are put in the stocks.&nbsp;
	This prevents him from sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame.&nbsp;
	It is a warning to halt in time on the path of evil.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	Bites through tender meat,<br />
	So that his nose disappears.<br />
	No blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case; it is like biting through tender meat.&nbsp;
	But one encounters a hardened sinner, and, aroused by anger, one goes a little too far.&nbsp; The disappearance of the nose in the course of the bite signifies that indignation blots out finer sensibility.&nbsp;
	However, there is no great harm in this, because the penalty as such is just.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>	Six in the third place means:<br />
	Bites on old dried meat<br />
	And strikes on something poisonous.<br />
	Slight humiliation.&nbsp; No blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Punishment is to be carried out by someone who lacks the power and authority to do so.&nbsp; Therefore the culprits do not submit.&nbsp;
	The matter at issue is an old one&mdash;as symbolized by salted game&mdash;and in dealing with it difficulties arise.&nbsp;
	This old meat is spoiled: by taking up the problem the punisher arouses poisonous hatred against himself, and in this way is put in a somewhat humiliating position.&nbsp;
	But since punishment was required by the time, he remains free of blame.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Bites on dried gristly meat.<br />
	Receives metal arrows.<br />
	It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties<br />
	And to be persevering.<br />
	Good fortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to be punished.&nbsp;
	Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds.&nbsp;
	But it is necessary to be hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the difficulties.&nbsp;
	If one knows these difficulties and remains persevering, he attains good fortune.&nbsp;
	The difficult task is achieved in the end.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Bites on dried lean meat.<br />
	Receives yellow gold.<br />
	Perseveringly aware of danger.<br />
	No blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	The case to be decided is indeed not easy but perfectly clear.&nbsp;
	Since we naturally incline to leniency, we must make every effort to be like yellow gold&mdash;that is, as true as gold and as impartial as yellow, the color of the middle [the mean].&nbsp;
	It is only by remaining conscious of the dangers growing out of the responsibility we have assumed that we can avoid making mistakes.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,<br />
	So that his ears disappear.<br />
	Misfortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	In contrast to the first line, this line refers to a man who is incorrigible.&nbsp;
	His punishment is the wooden cangue, and his ears disappear under it&mdash;that is to say, he is deaf to warnings.&nbsp;
	This obstinacy leads to misfortune.

<h2>22.&nbsp; Pi / Grace</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
	<img src="images/ken.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Pi" alt="&#9782;" /><i>above</i> K&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
	<br /><img src="images/li.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Pi" alt="&#9778;" /><i>below </i>LI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CLINGING, FIRE
</p>
<p>
	This hexagram shows a fire that breaks out of the secret depths of the earth and, blazing up, illuminates and beautifies the mountain, the heavenly heights.&nbsp;
	Grace&mdash;beauty of form&mdash;is necessary in any union if it is to be well ordered and pleasing rather than disordered and chaotic.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	GRACE has success.<br />
	In small matters<br />
	It is favorable to undertake something.
</p>
<p>
	Grace brings success.&nbsp;
	However, it is not the essential or fundamental thing; it is only the ornament and therefore be used sparingly and only in little things.&nbsp;
	In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between two strong lines and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the essential content and the weak line is the beautifying form.&nbsp;
	In the upper trigram of the mountain, the strong line takes the lead, so that here again the strong element must be regarded as the decisive factor.&nbsp;
	In nature we see in the sky the strong light of the sun; the life of the world depends on it.&nbsp;
	But this strong, essential thing is changed and given pleasing variety by the moon and the stars.&nbsp;
	In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when traditions exist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are made pleasing by a lucid beauty.&nbsp;
	By contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we come to understand time and its changing demands.&nbsp;
	Through contemplation of the forms existing in human society it becomes possible to shape the world.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Fire at the foot of the mountain:<br />
	The image of GRACE.<br />
	Thus does the superior man proceed<br />
	When clearing up current affairs.<br />
	But he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.
</p>
<p>
	The fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing, does not shine far; in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten and to throw light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions cannot be decided in this way.&nbsp;
	They require greater earnestness.
</p>


<a name="lines22"></a><h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	He lends grace to his toes, leaves the carriage, and walks.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	A beginner in subordinate place must take upon himself the labor of advancing.&nbsp;
	There might be an opportunity of surreptitiously easing the way&mdash;symbolized by the carriage&mdash;but a self&ndash;contained man scorns help gained in a dubious fashion.&nbsp;
	He thinks it more graceful to go on foot than to drive in a carriage under false pretenses.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	Lends grace to the beard on his chin.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	The beard is not an independent thing; it moves only with the chin.&nbsp;
	The image therefore means that form is to be considered only as a result and attribute of content.&nbsp;
	The beard is a superfluous ornament.&nbsp;
	To devote care to it for its own sake, without regard for the inner content of which it is an ornament, would bespeak a certain vanity.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	Graceful and moist.<br />
	Constant perseverance brings good fortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	This represents a very charming life situation.&nbsp;
	One is under the spell of grace and the mellow mood induced by wine.&nbsp;
	This grace can adorn, but it can also swamp us.&nbsp;
	Hence the warning not to sink into convivial indolence but to remain constant in perseverance.&nbsp;
	Good fortune depends on this.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fourth place means:<br />
	Grace or simplicity?<br />
	A white horse comes as if on wings.<br />
	He is not a robber,<br />
	He will woo at the right time.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	An individual is in a situation in which doubts arise as to which is better&mdash;to pursue the grace of external brilliance, or to return to simplicity.&nbsp;
	The doubt itself implies the answer.&nbsp;
	Confirmation comes from the outside; it comes like a white winged horse.&nbsp;
	The white color indicates simplicity.&nbsp;
	At first it may be disappointing to renounce comforts that might have been obtained, yet one finds peace of mind in a true relationship with the friend who courts him.&nbsp;
	The winged horse is the symbol of the thoughts that transcend all limits of space and time.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Grace in hills and gardens.<br />
	The roll of silk is meager and small.<br />
	Humiliation, but in the end good fortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	A man withdraws from contact with people of the lowlands, who seek nothing but magnificence and luxury, into the solitude of the heights.&nbsp;
	There he finds an individual to look up to, whom he would like to have as a friend.&nbsp;
	But the gifts he has to offer are poor and few, so that he feels ashamed.&nbsp;
	However, it is not the material gifts that count, but sincerity of feeling, and so all goes well in the end.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	Simple grace.&nbsp; No blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Here at the highest stage of development all ornament is discarded.&nbsp;
	Form no longer conceals content but brings out its value to the full.&nbsp;
	Perfect grace consists not in exterior ornamentation of the substance, but in the simple fitness of its form.

<h2>23.&nbsp; Po / Splitting Apart</h2>

<p class="subTitle">

</p>
<p>
	The dark lines are about to mount upward and overthrow the last firm, light line by exerting a disintegrating influence on it.&nbsp;
	The inferior, dark forces overcome what is superior and strong, not by direct means, but by undermining it gradually and imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses.
</p>
<p>
	The lines of the hexagram present the image of a house, the top line being the roof, and because the roof is being shattered the house collapses.&nbsp;
	The hexagram belongs to the ninth month (October&ndash;November).&nbsp;
	The yin power pushes up ever more powerfully and is about to supplant the yang power altogether.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	SPLITTING APART.&nbsp; It does not further one<br />
	To go anywhere.
</p>
<p>
	This pictures a time when inferior people are pushing forward and are about to crowd out the few remaining strong and superior men.&nbsp;
	Under these circumstances, which are due to the time, it is not favorable for the superior man to undertake anything.
</p>
<p>
	The right behavior in such adverse times is to be deduced from the images and their attributes.&nbsp;
	The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose attributes are docility and devotion.&nbsp;
	The upper trigram stands for the mountain, whose attribute is stillness.&nbsp;
	This suggests that one should submit to the bad time and remain quiet.&nbsp;
	For it is a question not of man&rsquo;s doing but of time conditions, which, according to the laws of heaven, show an alternation of increase and decrease, fullness and emptiness.&nbsp;
	It is impossible to counteract these conditions of the time.&nbsp;
	Hence it is not cowardice but wisdom to submit and avoid action.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	The mountain rests on the earth:<br />
	The image of SPLITTING APART.<br />
	Thus those above can ensure their position<br />
	Only by giving generously to those below.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The mountain rests on the earth.&nbsp;
	When it is steep and narrow, lacking a broad base, it must topple over.&nbsp;
	Its position is strong only when it rises out of the earth broad and great, not proud and steep.&nbsp;
	So likewise those who rule rest on the broad foundation of the people.&nbsp;
	They too should be generous and benevolent, like the earth that carries all.&nbsp;
	Then they will make their position as secure as a mountain is in its tranquillity.

	It no longer opposes the strong principle by means of intrigues but submits to its guidance.&nbsp;
	Indeed, as the head of the other weak lines, it leads all of these to the strong line, just as a princess leads her maids&ndash;in&ndash;waiting like a shoal of fishes to her husband and thus gains his favor.&nbsp;

	The superior man again attains influence and effectiveness.&nbsp;
	He is supported by public opinion as if in a carriage.&nbsp;
	But the inferior man&rsquo;s wickedness is visited upon himself.&nbsp;
	His house is split apart.&nbsp;
	A law of nature is at work here.&nbsp;
	Evil is not destructive to the good alone but inevitably destroys itself as well.&nbsp;
	For evil, which lives solely by negation, cannot continue to exist on its own strength alone.&nbsp;
	The inferior man himself fares best when held under control by a superior man.

<h2>24.&nbsp; Fu / Return (The Turning Point)</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/kun.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Fu" alt="&#9783;" /><i>above</i> K&rsquo;UN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

<p>
	The idea of a turning point arises from the fact that after the dark lines have pushed all of the light lines upward and out of the hexagram, another light line enters the hexagram from below.&nbsp;
	The time of darkness is past.&nbsp;
	The winter solstice brings the victory of light.&nbsp;
	This hexagram is linked with the eleventh month, the month of the solstice (December&ndash;January).
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	RETURN.&nbsp; Success.<br />
	Going out and coming in without error.<br />
	Friends come without blame.<br />
	To and fro goes the way.<br />
	On the seventh day comes return.<br />
	It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
</p>
<p>
	After a time of decay comes the turning point.&nbsp;
	The powerful light that has been banished returns.&nbsp;
	There is movement, but it is not brought about by force.&nbsp;
	The upper trigram K&rsquo;un is characterized by devotion; thus the movement is natural, arising spontaneously.&nbsp;
	For this reason the transformation of the old becomes easy.&nbsp;
	The old is discarded and the new is introduced.&nbsp;
	Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results.&nbsp;
	Societies of people sharing the same views are formed.&nbsp;
	But since these groups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made.&nbsp;
	The idea of RETURN is based on the course of nature.&nbsp;
	The movement is cyclic, and the course completes itself.&nbsp;
	Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially.&nbsp;
	Everything comes of itself at the appointed time.&nbsp;
	This is the meaning of heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>
	All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return.&nbsp;
	Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset.&nbsp;
	Therefore seven is the number of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the great darkness, is increased by one.&nbsp;
	In this way the state of rest gives place to movement.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Thunder within the earth:<br />
	The image of THE TURNING POINT.<br />
	Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes<br />
	At the time of solstice.<br />
	Merchants and strangers did not go about,<br />
	And the ruler<br />
	Did not travel through the provinces.
</p>
<p>
	The winter solstice has always been celebrated in China as the resting time of the year&mdash;a custom that survives in the time of rest observed at the new year.&nbsp;
	In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the Arousing, is still underground.&nbsp;
	Movement is just at its beginning; therefore it must be strengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being used prematurely.&nbsp;
	This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing itself to be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations.&nbsp;
	The return of health after illness, the return of understanding after an estrangement: everything must be treated tenderly and with care at the beginning, so that the return may lead to a flowering.

</li></ul><p><br />
	Slight digressions from the good cannot be avoided, but one must turn back in time, before going too far.&nbsp;
	This is especially important in the development of character; every faintly evil thought must be put aside immediately, before it goes too far and takes root in the mind.&nbsp;
	Then there is no cause for remorse, and all goes well.

	There is danger in continually deserting the good because of uncontrolled desires, then turning back to it again because of a better resolution.&nbsp;

<h2>25.&nbsp; Wu Wang / Innocence (The Unexpected)</h2>

<p class="subTitle">

<br /><img src="images/chen.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Wu Wang" alt="&#9779;" /><i>below </i>CH&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE AROUSING, THUNDER
</p>
<p>
	Ch&rsquo;ien, heaven is above; Ch&ecirc;n, movement, is below.&nbsp;
	The lower trigram Ch&ecirc;n is under the influence of the strong line it has received from above, from heaven.&nbsp;
	When, in accord with this, movement follows the law of heaven, man is innocent and without guile.&nbsp;
	His mind is natural and true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs.&nbsp;
	For wherever conscious purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been lost.&nbsp;
	Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate nature.&nbsp;
	Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought in part goes somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea of the unintentional or unexpected.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	INNOCENCE.&nbsp; Supreme success.<br />
	Perseverance furthers.<br />
	If someone is not as he should be,<br />
	He has misfortune,<br />
	And it does not further him<br />
	To undertake anything.
</p>
<p>
	Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him in all his movements.&nbsp;
	By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage.&nbsp;
	This instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and &ldquo;furthers through perseverance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will of heaven.&nbsp;
	Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of acting brings only misfortune.&nbsp;
	Confucius says about this: &ldquo;He who departs from innocence, what does he come to? Heaven&rsquo;s will and blessing do not go with his deeds.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">

	All things attain the natural state of innocence.<br />
	Thus the kings of old,<br />

</p>
<p>
	In springtime when thunder, life energy, begins to move again under the heavens, everything sprouts and grows, and all beings receive from the creative activity of nature the childlike innocence of their original state.&nbsp;
	So it is with the good rulers of mankind: drawing on the spiritual wealth at their command, they take care of all forms of life and all forms of culture and do everything to further them, and at the proper time.

<h2>26.&nbsp; Ta Ch&rsquo;u / The Taming Power of the Great</h2>
<p class="subTitle">

</p>
<p>
	The Creative is tamed by K&ecirc;n, Keeping Still.&nbsp;
	This produces great power, a situation in contrast to that of the <a class="inlineRef" href="bk1h1-10.html#9">ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch&rsquo;u, THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL</a>, in which the Creative is tamed by the Gentle alone.&nbsp;
	There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is far stronger.
</p>
<p>
	The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the concept &ldquo;holding firm.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram K&ecirc;n which holds the trigram Ch&rsquo;ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and nourishing.&nbsp;
	This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage.&nbsp;
	The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, which represents the sage.
</p>

	THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.<br />

</p>
<p>
	To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear&ndash;headed man who is honored by the ruler.&nbsp;
	The trigram Ch&rsquo;ien points to strong creative power;
	K&ecirc;n indicates firmness and truth.&nbsp;
	Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of character.&nbsp;
	Only through such daily self&ndash;renewal can a man continue at the height of his powers.&nbsp;
	Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the power of the personality.&nbsp;
	However, since the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one&rsquo;s bread by entering upon public office.&nbsp;
	Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>

</p>
<p>
	Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures.&nbsp;
	In the words and deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to strengthen and elevate their own characters.&nbsp;
	The way to study the past is not to confine oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application of this knowledge, to give actuality to the past.

	However, in the later the restraining force is slight; thus a conflict arises between the propulsive and the restraining movement, as a result of which the spokes fall out of the wagon wheels, while here the restraining force is absolutely superior; hence no struggle takes place.&nbsp;
	One submits and removes the axletrees from the wagon&mdash;in other words, contents himself with waiting.&nbsp;
	In this way energy accumulates for a vigorous advance later on.

</li></ul><p><br />
	The way opens; the hindrance has been cleared away.&nbsp;
	A man is in contact with a strong will acting in the same direction as his own, and goes forward like one good horse following another.&nbsp;
	But danger still threatens, and he must remain aware of it, or he will be robbed of his firmness.&nbsp;
	Thus he must acquire skill on the one hand in what will take him forward, and on the other in what will protect him against unforeseen attacks.&nbsp;
	It is good in such a pass to have a goal toward which to strive.

	Before a bull&rsquo;s horns grow out, a headboard is fastened to its forehead, so that later when the horns appear they cannot do harm.&nbsp;
	A good way to restrain wild force is to forestall it.&nbsp;
	By so doing one achieves an easy and a great success.

	A boar&rsquo;s tusk is in itself dangerous, but if the boar&rsquo;s nature is altered, the tusk is no longer a menace.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
	This hexagram is a picture of an open mouth; above and below are firm lines of the lips, and between them the opening.&nbsp;
	Starting with the mouth, through which we take food for nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment itself.&nbsp;
	Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented in the three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent nourishment and care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.<br />
	Perseverance brings good fortune.<br />
	Pay heed to the providing of nourishment<br />
	And to what a man seeks<br />
	To fill his own mouth with.
</p>
<p>
	In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right people should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment in the right way.&nbsp;
	If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates and nourishes.&nbsp;
	Nature nourishes all creatures.&nbsp;
	The great man fosters and takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through them.&nbsp;
	Mencius says about this:
<span class="quote"><!-- open quote -->
	If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only observe what part of his being he regards as especially important.&nbsp;
	The body has superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts.&nbsp;
	We must not injure important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we injure the superior parts for the sake of the inferior.&nbsp;
	He who cultivates the inferior parts of his nature is an inferior man.&nbsp;
	He who cultivates the superior parts of his nature is a superior man.
</span>
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	At the foot of the mountain, thunder:<br />
	The image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT.<br />
	Thus the superior man is careful of his words<br />

<p>
	&ldquo;God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing&rdquo;: when in the spring the life forces stir again, all things comes into being anew.&nbsp;
	&ldquo;He brings to perfection in the sign of Keeping Still&rdquo;: thus in the early spring, when the seeds fall to earth, all things are made ready.&nbsp;
	This is an image of providing nourishment through movement and tranquillity.&nbsp;
	The superior man takes it as a pattern for the nourishment and cultivation of his character.&nbsp;
	Words are a movement going from within outward.&nbsp;
	Eating and drinking are movements from without inward.&nbsp;
	Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity.&nbsp;
	For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding its proper measure.&nbsp;
	Thus character is cultivated.

</li></ul><p><br />
	The magic tortoise is a creature possessed of such supernatural powers that it lives on air and needs no earthly nourishment.&nbsp;
	The image means that a man fitted by nature and position to live freely and independently renounces this self&ndash;reliance and instead looks with envy and discontent at others who are outwardly in better circumstances.&nbsp;
	But such base envy only arouses derision and contempt in those others.&nbsp;
	This has bad results.

</li></ul><p><br />
	Normally a person either provides his own means of nourishment or is supported in a proper way by those whose duty and privilege it is to provide for him.&nbsp;
	If, owing to weakness of spirit, a man cannot support himself, a feeling of uneasiness comes over him; this is because in shirking the proper way of obtaining a living, he accepts support as a favor from those in higher place.&nbsp;
	This is unworthy, for he is deviating from his true nature.&nbsp;

</li></ul><p><br />
	He who seeks nourishment that does not nourish reels from desire to gratification and in gratification craves desire.&nbsp;
	Mad pursuit of pleasure for the satisfaction of the senses never brings one to the goal.&nbsp;
	One should never (ten years is a complete cycle of time) follow this path, for nothing good can come of it.

</li></ul><p><br />
	In contrast to the six in the second place, which refers to a man bent exclusively on his own advantage, this line refers to one occupying a high position and striving to let his light shine forth.&nbsp;
	To do this he needs helpers, because he cannot attain his lofty aim alone.&nbsp;
	With the greed of a hungry tiger he is on the lookout for the right people.&nbsp;
	Since he is not working for himself but for the good of all, there is no wrong in such zeal.

</li></ul><p><br />
	A man may be conscious of a deficiency in himself.&nbsp;
	He should be undertaking the nourishment of the people, but he has not the strength to do it.&nbsp;
	Thus he must turn from his accustomed path and beg counsel and help from a man who is spiritually his superior but undistinguished outwardly.&nbsp;
	If he maintains this attitude of mind perseveringly, success and good fortune are his.&nbsp;
	But he must remain aware of his dependence.&nbsp;
	He must not put his own person forward nor attempt great labors, such as crossing the great water.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	The source of nourishment.<br />
	Awareness of danger brings good fortune.<br />
	It furthers one to cross the great water.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	This describes a sage of the highest order, from whom emanate all influences that provide nourishment for others.&nbsp;
	Such a position brings with it heavy responsibility.&nbsp;
	If he remains conscious of this fact, he has good fortune and may confidently undertake even great and difficult labors, such as crossing the great water.&nbsp;
	These undertakings bring general happiness for him and for all others.

<p>
	This hexagram consists of four strong lines inside and two weak lines outside.&nbsp;
	When the strong are outside and the weak inside, all is well and there is nothing out of balance, nothing extraordinary in the situation.&nbsp;
	Here, however, the opposite is the case.&nbsp;
	The hexagram represents a beam that is thick and heavy in the middle but too weak at the ends.&nbsp;
	This is a condition that cannot last; it must be changed, must pass, or misfortune will result.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	The weight of the great is excessive.&nbsp;
	The load is too heavy for the strength of the supports.&nbsp;
	The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests, sags to the breaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for the load they bear.&nbsp;
	It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore extraordinary measures are demanded.&nbsp;
	It is necessary to find a way of transition as quickly as possible, and to take action.&nbsp;
	This promises success.&nbsp;
	For although the strong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center of gravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared.&nbsp;
	Nothing is to be achieved by forcible measures.&nbsp;
	The problem must be solved by gentle penetration to the meaning of the situation (as is suggested by the attribute of the inner trigram, Sun); then the change&ndash;over to other conditions will be successful.&nbsp;
	It demands real superiority; therefore the time when the great preponderates is a momentous time.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>

</p>
<p>
	Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like floodtimes when the lake rises over the treetops.&nbsp;
	But such conditions are temporary.&nbsp;
	The two trigrams indicate the attitude proper to such exceptional times: the symbol of the trigram Sun is the tree, which stands firm even though it stands alone, and the attribute of Tui is joyousness, which remains undaunted even if it must renounce the world.

	When a man wishes to undertake an enterprise in extraordinary times, he must be extraordinarily cautious, just as when setting a heavy thing down on the floor, one takes care to put rushes under it, so that nothing will break.&nbsp;
	This caution, though it may seem exaggerated, is not a mistake.&nbsp;
	Exceptional enterprises cannot succeed unless utmost caution is observed in their beginnings and in the laying of their foundations.

</li></ul><p><br />
	Wood is near water; hence the image of an old poplar sprouting at the root.&nbsp;
	This means an extraordinary reanimation of the process of growth.&nbsp;
	In the same way, an extraordinary situation arises when an older man marries a young girl who suits him.&nbsp;
	Despite the unusualness of the situation, all goes well.
<br /><br />
	From the point of view of politics, the meaning is that in exceptional times one does well to join with the lowly, for this affords a possibility of renewal.

	He accepts no advice from others, and therefore they in turn are not willing to lend him support.&nbsp;
	Because of this the burden grows, until the structure of things bends or breaks.&nbsp;
	Plunging willfully ahead in times of danger only hastens the catastrophe.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	The ridgepole is braced.&nbsp;Good fortune.<br />

	Through friendly relations with people of lower rank, a responsible man succeeds in becoming master of the situation.&nbsp;

	A withered poplar that flowers exhausts its energies thereby and only hastens its end.&nbsp;

	Everything remains barren.&nbsp;

	Here is a situation in which the unusual has reached a climax.&nbsp;
	One is courageous and wishes to accomplish one&rsquo;s task, no matter what happens.&nbsp;
	This leads into danger.&nbsp;
	The water rises over one&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
	This is the misfortune.&nbsp;
	But one incurs no blame in giving up one&rsquo;s life that the good and the right may prevail.&nbsp;
	There are things that are more important than life.

<h2>29.&nbsp; K&rsquo;an / The Abysmal (Water)</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/kan.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for K&rsquo;an" alt="&#9781;" /><i>above</i> K&rsquo;AN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE ABYSMAL, WATER
<br /><img src="images/kan.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for K&rsquo;an" alt="&#9781;" /><i>below </i>K&rsquo;AN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE ABYSMAL, WATER
</p>
<p>
	This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K&rsquo;an.&nbsp;
	It is one of the eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs.&nbsp;
	The trigram K&rsquo;an means a plunging in.&nbsp;
	A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed in by them like water in a ravine.&nbsp;
	The trigram K&rsquo;an is also the middle son.&nbsp;
	The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus K&rsquo;an develops.&nbsp;
	As an image it represents water, the water that comes from above and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving rise to all life on earth.
</p>
<p>
	 In man&rsquo;s world K&rsquo;an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark&mdash;that is, reason.&nbsp;
	The name of the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning, &ldquo;repetition of danger.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an objective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective attitude.&nbsp;
	For danger due to a subjective attitude means either foolhardiness or guile.&nbsp;
	Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger; it is a situation in which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine, and, like the water, he can escape if he behaves correctly.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	The Abysmal repeated.<br />
	If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,<br />
	And whatever you do succeeds.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it.&nbsp;
	Water sets the example for the right conduct under such circumstances.&nbsp;
	It flows on and on, and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not shrink from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose its own essential nature.&nbsp;
	It remains true to itself under all conditions.&nbsp;
	Thus likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can penetrate the meaning of the situation.&nbsp;
	And once we have gained inner mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will succeed.&nbsp;
	In danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be done&mdash;thoroughness&mdash;and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in the danger.
</p>
<p>
	 Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective measure.&nbsp;
	Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water, separating countries by their dangers.&nbsp;
	Thus also rulers make use of danger to protect themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil within.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its goal:<br />
	The image of the Abysmal repeated.<br />
	Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue<br />
	And carries on the business of teaching.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Water reaches its goal by flowing continually.&nbsp;
	It fills up every depression before it flows on.&nbsp;
	The superior man follows its example; he is concerned that goodness should be an established attribute of character rather than an accidental and isolated occurrence.&nbsp;
	So likewise in teaching others everything depends on consistency, for it is only through repetition that the pupil makes the material his own.
</p>


<a name="lines29"></a><h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	Repetition of the Abysmal.<br />
	In the abyss one falls into a pit.<br />
	Misfortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	By growing used to what is dangerous, a man can easily allow it to become part of him.&nbsp;
	He is familiar with it and grows used to evil.&nbsp;
	With this he has lost the right way, and misfortune is the natural result.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	The abyss is dangerous.<br />
	One should strive to attain small things only.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	When we are in danger we ought not to attempt to get out of it immediately, regardless of circumstances; at first we must content ourselves with not being overcome by it.&nbsp;
	We must calmly weigh the conditions of the time and by satisfied with small gains, because for the time being a great success cannot be attained.&nbsp;
	A spring flows only sparingly at first, and tarries for some time before it makes its way in to the open.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the third place means:<br />
	Forward and backward, abyss on abyss.<br />
	In danger like this, pause at first and wait,<br />
	Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.<br />
	Do not act this way.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Here every step, forward or backward, leads into danger.&nbsp;
	Escape is out of the question.&nbsp;
	Therefore we must not be misled into action, as a result of which we should only bog down deeper in the danger; disagreeable as it may be to remain in such a situation, we must wait until a way out shows itself.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fourth place means:<br />
	A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it;<br />
	Earthen vessels<br />
	Simply handed in through the Window.<br />
	There is certainly no blame in this.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	In times of danger ceremonious forms are dropped.&nbsp;
	What matters most is sincerity.&nbsp;
	Although as a rule it is customary for an official to present certain introductory gifts and recommendations before he is appointed, here everything is simplified to the utmost.&nbsp;
	The gifts are insignificant, there is no one to sponsor him, he introduces himself; yet all this need not be humiliating if only there is the honest intention of mutual help in danger.&nbsp;
	Still another idea is suggested.&nbsp;
	The window is the place through which light enters the room.&nbsp;
	If in difficult times we want to enlighten someone, we must begin with that which is in itself lucid and proceed quite simply from that point on.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	The abyss is not filled to overflowing,<br />
	It is filled only to the rim.<br />
	No blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Danger comes because one is too ambitious.&nbsp;
	In order to flow out of a ravine, water does not rise higher than the lowest point of the rim.&nbsp;
	So likewise a man when in danger has only to proceed along the line of least resistance; thus he reaches the goal.&nbsp;
	Great labors cannot be accomplished in such times; it is enough to get out of the danger.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	Bound with cords and ropes,<br />
	Shut in between thorn&ndash;hedged prison walls:<br />
	For three years one does not find the way.<br />
	Misfortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	A man who in the extremity of danger has lost the right way and is irremediably entangled in his sins has no prospect of escape.&nbsp;
	He is like a criminal who sits shackled behind thorn&ndash;hedged prison walls.

<h2>30.&nbsp; Li / The Clinging, Fire</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/li.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Li" alt="&#9778;" /><i>above</i> LI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CLINGING, FIRE
<br /><img src="images/li.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Li" alt="&#9778;" /><i>below </i>LI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CLINGING, FIRE
</p>
<p>
	This hexagram is another double sign.&nbsp;
	The trigram Li means &ldquo;to cling to something,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;brightness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	A dark line clings to two light lines, one above and one below&mdash;the image of an empty space between two strong lines, whereby the two strong lines are made bright.&nbsp;
	The trigram represents the middle daughter.&nbsp;
	The Creative has incorporated the central line of the Receptive, and thus Li develops.&nbsp;
	As an image, it is fire.&nbsp;
	Fire has no definite form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright.&nbsp;
	As water pours down from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth.&nbsp;
	While K&rsquo;an means the soul shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	THE CLINGING.&nbsp; Perseverance furthers.<br />
	It brings success.<br />
	Care of the cow brings good fortune.<br />
</p>
<p>
	What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of the latter.&nbsp;
	A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself something that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out.&nbsp;
	Everything that gives light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may continue to shine.
</p>
<p>
	 Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling to the earth.&nbsp;
	So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to what is right and thereby can shape the world.&nbsp;
	Human life on earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he achieves success.&nbsp;
	The cow is the symbol of extreme docility.&nbsp;
	By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	That which is bright rises twice:<br />
	The image of FIRE.<br />
	Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,<br />
	Illumines the four quarters of the world.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day.&nbsp;
	The two together represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function of light with respect to time.&nbsp;
	The great man continues the work of nature in the human world.&nbsp;
	Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light to spread farther and farther and to penetrate the nature of man ever more deeply.
</p>


<a name="lines30"></a><h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	The footprints run crisscross.<br />
	If one is seriously intent, no blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	It is early morning and work begins.&nbsp;
	The mind has been closed to the outside world in sleep; now its connections with the world begin again.&nbsp;
	The traces of one&rsquo;s impressions run crisscross.&nbsp;
	Activity and haste prevail.&nbsp;
	It is important then to preserve inner composure and not to allow oneself to be swept along by the bustle of life.&nbsp;
	If one is serious and composed, he can acquire the clarity of mind needed for coming to terms with the innumerable impressions that pour in.&nbsp;
	It is precisely at the beginning that serious concentration is important, because the beginning holds the seed of all that is to follow.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	Yellow light.&nbsp; Supreme good fortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Midday has come; the sun shines with a yellow light.&nbsp;
	Yellow is the color of measure and mean.&nbsp;
	Yellow light is therefore a symbol of the highest culture and art, whose consummate harmony consists in holding to the mean.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	In the light of the setting sun,<br />
	Men either beat the pot and sing<br />
	Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.<br />
	Misfortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Here the end of the day has come.&nbsp;
	The light of the setting sun calls to mind the fact that life is transitory and conditional.&nbsp;
	Caught in this external bondage, men are usually robbed of their inner freedom as well.&nbsp;
	The sense of the transitoriness of life impels them to uninhibited revelry in order to enjoy life while it lasts, or else they yield to melancholy and spoil the precious time by lamenting the approach of old age.&nbsp;
	Both attitudes are wrong.&nbsp;
	To the superior man it makes no difference whether death comes early or late.&nbsp;
	He cultivates himself, awaits his allotted time, and in this way secures his fate.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Its coming is sudden;<br />
	It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Clarity of mind has the same relation to life that fire has to wood.&nbsp;
	Fire clings to wood, but also consumes it.&nbsp;
	Clarity of mind is rooted in life but can also consume it.&nbsp;
	Everything depends upon how the clarity functions.&nbsp;
	Here the image used is that of a meteor or a straw fire.&nbsp;
	A man who is excitable and restless may rise quickly to prominence but produces no lasting effects.&nbsp;
	Thus matters end badly when a man spends himself too rapidly and consumes himself like a meteor.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.<br />
	Good fortune.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	Here the zenith of life has been reached.&nbsp;
	Were there no warning, one would at this point consume oneself like a flame.&nbsp;
	Instead, understanding the vanity of all things, one may put aside both hope and fear, and sigh and lament: if one is intent on retaining his clarity of mind, good fortune will come from this grief.&nbsp;
	For here we are dealing not with a passing mood, as in the nine in the third place, but with a real change of heart.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	The king used him to march forth and chastise.<br />
	Then it is best to kill the leaders<br />
	And take captive the followers.&nbsp; No blame.<br />
</li></ul><p><br />
	It is not the purpose of chastisement to impose punishment blindly but to create discipline.&nbsp;
	Evil must be cured at its roots.&nbsp;
	To eradicate evil in political life, it is best to kill the ringleaders and spare the followers.&nbsp;
	In educating oneself it is best to root out bad habits and tolerate those that are harmless.&nbsp;
	For asceticism that is too strict, like sentences of undue severity, fails in its purpose.
