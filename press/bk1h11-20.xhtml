			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
		</p>
		<p>The Receptive, which moves downward, stands above; the
			Creative, which moves upward, is below.&nbsp; Hence their influences
			meet and are in harmony, so that all living things bloom and
			prosper.&nbsp; This hexagram belongs to the first month
			(February&ndash;March), at which time the forces of nature prepare
			the new spring.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			PEACE.&nbsp; The small departs,<br /> The great approaches.<br />
			Good fortune.&nbsp; Success.
		</p>
		<p>This hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to be
			on earth.&nbsp; Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so
			their powers unite in deep harmony.&nbsp; Then peace and blessing
			descend upon all living things.</p>
		<p>In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in
			high places show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior in
			their turn are well disposed toward the highly placed.&nbsp; There is
			an end to all feuds.</p>
		<p>Inside, at the center, in the key position, is the light
			principle; the dark principle is outside.&nbsp; Thus the light has a
			powerful influence, while the dark is submissive.&nbsp; In this way
			each receives its due.&nbsp; When the good elements of society occupy
			a central position and are in control, the evil elements come under
			their influence and change for the better.&nbsp; When the spirit of
			heaven rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence
			and takes its appropriate place.</p>
		<p>The individual lines enter the hexagram from below and leave it
			again at the top.&nbsp; Here the small, weak, and evil elements are
			about to take their departure, while the great, strong, and good
			elements are moving up.&nbsp; This brings good fortune and success.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			Heaven and earth unite: the image of PEACE.<br /> Thus the ruler<br />
			Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth;<br /> He
			furthers and regulates the gifts of heaven and earth,<br /> And so
			aids the people.<br />
		</p>
		<p>Heaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences,
			producing a time of universal flowering and prosperity.&nbsp; This
			stream of energy must be regulated by the ruler of men.&nbsp; It is
			done by a process of division.&nbsp; Thus men divide the uniform flow
			of time into the seasons, according to the succession of natural
			phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the points of the
			compass.&nbsp; In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion of
			phenomena is bounded and controlled.&nbsp; One the other hand, nature
			must be furthered in her productiveness.&nbsp; This is done by
			adjusting the products to the right time and the right place, which
			increases the natural yield.&nbsp; This controlling and furthering
			activity of man in his relation to nature is the work on nature that
			rewards him.</p>



		
		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> When
				ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.<br /> Each
				according to his kind.<br /> Undertakings bring good fortune.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In times of prosperity every able man called to fill an
			office draws like&ndash;minded people along with him, just as in
			pulling up ribbon grass one always pulls up a bunch of it, because
			the stalks are connected by their roots.&nbsp; In such times, when it
			is possible to extend influence widely, the mind of an able man is
			set upon going out into life and accomplishing something.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness,<br /> Fording the river
				with resolution,<br /> Not neglecting what is distant,<br /> Not
				regarding one&rsquo;s companions:<br /> Thus one may manage to walk
				in the middle.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In times of prosperity it is important above all to possess
			enough greatness of soul to bear with imperfect people.&nbsp; For in
			the hands of a great master no material is unproductive; he can find
			use for everything.&nbsp; But this generosity is by no means laxity
			or weakness.&nbsp; It is during times of prosperity especially that
			we must always be ready to risk even dangerous undertakings, such as
			the crossing of a river, if they are necessary.&nbsp; So too we must
			not neglect what is distant but must attend scrupulously to
			everything.&nbsp; Factionalism and the dominance of cliques are
			especially to be avoided.&nbsp; Even if people of like mind come
			forward together, they ought not to form a faction by holding
			together for mutual advantage; instead, each man should do his
			duty.&nbsp; These are four ways in which one can overcome the hidden
			danger of a gradual slackening that always lurks in any time of
			peace.&nbsp; And that is how one finds the middle way for action.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> No
				plain not followed by a slope.<br /> No going not followed by a
				return.<br /> He who remains persevering in danger<br /> Is
				without blame.<br /> Do not complain about this truth;<br /> Enjoy
				the good fortune you still possess.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Everything on earth is subject to change.&nbsp; Prosperity is
			followed by decline: this is the eternal law on earth.&nbsp; Evil can
			indeed be held in check but not permanently abolished.&nbsp; It
			always returns.&nbsp; This conviction might induct melancholy, but it
			should not; it ought only to keep us from falling into illusion when
			good fortune comes to us.&nbsp; If we continue mindful of the danger,
			we remain persevering and make no mistakes.&nbsp; As long as a
			man&rsquo;s inner nature remains stronger and richer than anything
			offered by external fortune, as long as he remains inwardly superior
			to fate, fortune will not desert him.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br /> He
				flutters down, not boasting of his wealth,<br /> Together with his
				neighbor,<br /> Guileless and sincere.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In times of mutual confidence, people of high rank come in
			close contact with the lowly quite simply and without boasting of
			their wealth.&nbsp; This is not due to the force of circumstances but
			corresponds with their inmost sentiment.&nbsp; The approach is made
			quite spontaneously, because it is based on inner conviction.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br /> The
				sovereign I<br /> Gives his daughter in marriage.<br /> This
				brings blessing<br /> And supreme good fortune.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The sovereign I is T&rsquo;ang the Completer.&nbsp; By his
			decree the imperial princesses, although higher in rank than their
			husbands, had to obey them like all other wives.&nbsp; Here too we
			are shown a truly modest union of high and low that brings happiness
			and blessings.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> The wall falls
				back into the moat.<br /> Use no army now.<br /> Make your
				commands known within your own town.<br /> Perseverance brings
				humiliation.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The change alluded to in the middle of the hexagram has begun
			to take place.&nbsp; The wall of the town sinks back into the moat
			from which it was dug.&nbsp; The hour of doom is at hand.&nbsp; When
			matters have come to this pass, we should submit to fate and not try
			to stave it off by violent resistance.&nbsp; The one recourse left us
			is to hold our own within our intimate circle.&nbsp; Should we
			persevere in trying to resist the evil in the usual way, our collapse
			would only be more complete, and humiliation would be the result.

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
		</p>
		<p>This hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one.&nbsp;
			Heaven is above, drawing farther and farther away, while the earth
			below sinks farther into the depths.&nbsp; The creative powers are
			not in relation.&nbsp; It is a time of standstill and decline.&nbsp;
			This hexagram is linked with the seventh month
			(August&ndash;September), when the year has passed its zenith and
			autumnal decay is setting in.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			STANDSTILL.&nbsp; Evil people do not further<br /> The perseverance
			of the superior man.<br /> The great departs; the small approaches.
		</p>
		<p>Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are
			benumbed.&nbsp; What is above has no relation to what is below, and
			on earth confusion and disorder prevail.&nbsp; The dark power is
			within, the light power is without.&nbsp; Weakness is within,
			harshness without.&nbsp; Within are the inferior, and without are the
			superior.&nbsp; The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of
			superior people is one the decline.&nbsp; But the superior people do
			not allow themselves to be turned from their principles.&nbsp; If the
			possibility of exerting influence is closed to them, they
			nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and withdraw into
			seclusion.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			Heaven and earth do not unite:<br /> The image of STANDSTILL.<br />
			Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth<br /> In order
			to escape the difficulties.<br /> He does not permit himself to be
			honored with revenue.<br />
		</p>
		<p>When, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust
			prevails in public life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible,
			because the fundaments are wrong.&nbsp; Therefore the superior man
			knows what he must do under such circumstances; he does not allow
			himself to be tempted by dazzling offers to take part in public
			activities.&nbsp; This would only expose him to danger, since he
			cannot assent to the meanness of the others.&nbsp; He therefore hides
			his worth and withdraws into seclusion.</p>



		
		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> When
				ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.<br /> Each
				according to his kind.<br /> Perseverance brings good fortune and
				success.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The text is almost the same as that of the first line of the
			preceding hexagram, but with a contrary meaning.&nbsp; In the latter
			a man is drawing another along with him on the road to an official
			career; here a man is drawing another with him into retirement from
			public life.&nbsp; This is why the text says here,
			&ldquo;Perseverance brings good fortune and success,&rdquo; and not
			&ldquo;Undertakings bring good fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it becomes
			impossible to make our influence count, it is only by retirement that
			we spare ourselves humiliation.&nbsp; Success in a higher sense can
			be ours, because we know how to safeguard the value of our
			personalities.
		</p>

		<ul class="constRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br /> They
				bear and endure;<br /> This means good fortune for inferior people.<br />
				The standstill serves to help the great man to attain success.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Inferior people are ready to flatter their superiors in a
			servile way.&nbsp; They would also endure the superior man if he
			would put an end to their confusion.&nbsp; This is fortunate for
			them.&nbsp; But the great man calmly bears the consequences of the
			standstill.&nbsp; He does not mingle with the crowd of the inferior;
			that is not his place.&nbsp; By his willingness to suffer personally
			he insures the success of his fundamental principles.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> They
				bear shame.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Inferior people who have risen to power illegitimately do not
			feel equal to the responsibility they have taken upon
			themselves.&nbsp; In their hearts they begin to be ashamed, although
			at first they do not show it outwardly.&nbsp; This marks a turn for
			the better.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br /> He
				who acts at the command of the highest<br /> Remains without blame.<br />
				Those of like mind partake of the blessing.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The time of standstill is nearing the point of change into
			its opposite.&nbsp; Whoever wishes to restore order must feel himself
			called to the task and have the necessary authority.&nbsp; A man who
			sets himself up a capable of creating order according to his own
			judgment could make mistakes and end in failure.&nbsp; But the man
			who is truly called to the task is favored by the conditions of the
			time, and all those of like mind will share in his blessing.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br />
				Standstill is giving way.<br /> Good fortune for the great man.<br />
				&ldquo;What if it should fail, what if it should fail?&rdquo;<br />
				In this way he ties it to a cluster of mulberry shoots.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The time undergoes a change.&nbsp; The right man, able to
			restore order, has arrived.&nbsp; Hence &ldquo;Good
			fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; But such periods of transition are the very
			times in which we must fear and tremble.&nbsp; Success is assured
			only through greatest caution, which asks always, "What if it should
			fail?&rdquo;&nbsp; When a mulberry bush is cut down, a number of
			unusually strong shoots sprout from the roots.&nbsp; Hence the image
			of tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used to
			symbolize the way of making success certain.&nbsp; Confucius says
			about this line: <br /> <br /> <span class="quote"> <!-- open quote -->
				Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position.&nbsp;
				Destruction threatens when a man seeks to preserve his worldly
				estate.&nbsp; Confusion develops when a man has put everything in
				order.&nbsp; Therefore the superior man does not forget danger in
				his security, nor ruin when he is well established, nor confusion
				when his affairs are in order.&nbsp; In this way he gains personal
				safety and is able to protect the empire.
			</span>
			<!-- closes quote -->
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> The
				standstill comes to an end.<br /> First standstill, then good
				fortune.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The standstill does not last forever.&nbsp; However, it does
			not cease of its own accord; the right man is needed to end it.&nbsp;
			This is the difference between a state of peace and a state of
			stagnation.&nbsp; Continuous effort is necessary to maintain peace:
			left to itself it would change into stagnation and
			disintegration.&nbsp; The time of disintegration, however, does not
			change back automatically to a condition of peace and prosperity;
			effort must be put forth in order to end it.&nbsp; This shows the
			creative attitude that man must take if the world is to be put in
			order.

		<h2>13.&nbsp; T&rsquo;ung J&ecirc;n / Fellowship with Men</h2>

		<p class="subTitle">

				title="upper trigram for T&rsquo;ung J&ecirc;n" alt="&#9776;" /><i>above</i>
			CH&rsquo;IEN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN <br /> <img

				title="lower trigram for T&rsquo;ung J&ecirc;n" alt="&#9778;" /><i>below
			</i>LI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CLINGING, FLAME
		</p>
		<p>
			The image of the upper trigram Ch&rsquo;ien is heaven, and that of
			the lower, Li, is flame.&nbsp; It is the nature of fire to flame up
			to heaven.&nbsp; This gives the idea of fellowship.&nbsp; It is the
			second line that, by virtue of its central character, unites the five
			strong lines around it.&nbsp; This hexagram forms a complement to <a
				class="inlineRef" href="bk1h1-10.html#7">Shih, THE ARMY (7)</a>.&nbsp;
			In the latter, danger is within and obedience without&mdash;the
			character of a warlike army, which, in order to hold together, needs
			one strong man among the many who are weak.&nbsp; Here, clarity is
			within and strength without&mdash;the character of a peaceful union
			of men, which, in order to hold together, needs one yielding nature
			among many firm persons.
		</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.<br /> Success.<br /> It furthers
			one to cross the great water.<br /> The perseverance of the superior
			man furthers.
		</p>
		<p>True fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is
			universal.&nbsp; It is not the private interests of the individual
			that create lasting fellowship among men, but rather the goals of
			humanity.&nbsp; That is why it is said that fellowship with men in
			the open succeeds.&nbsp; If unity of this kind prevails, even
			difficult and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can
			be accomplished.&nbsp; But in order to bring about this sort of
			fellowship, a persevering and enlightened leader is needed&mdash;a
			man with clear, convincing, and inspiring aims and the strength to
			carry them out.&nbsp; (The inner trigram means clarity; the outer,
			strength.)</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			Heaven together with fire:<br /> The image of FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN.<br />
			Thus the superior man organizes the clans<br /> And makes
			distinctions between things.<br />
		</p>
		<p>Heaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is
			different from fire.&nbsp; Just as the luminaries in the sky serve
			for the systematic division and arrangement of time, so human society
			and all things that really belong together must be organically
			arranged.&nbsp; Fellowship should not be a mere mingling of
			individuals or of things&mdash;that would be chaos, not
			fellowship.&nbsp; If fellowship is to lead to order, there must be
			organization within diversity.</p>



		
		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br />
				Fellowship with men at the gate.<br /> No blame.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The beginning of union among people should take place before
			the door.&nbsp; All are equally close to one another.&nbsp; No
			divergent aims have yet arisen, and one makes no mistakes.&nbsp; The
			basic principles of any kind of union must be equally accessible to
			all concerned.&nbsp; Secret agreements bring misfortune.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Fellowship with men in the clan.<br /> Humiliation.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			There is danger here of formation of a separate faction on
			the basis of personal and egotistic interests.&nbsp; Such factions,
			which are exclusive and, instead of welcoming all men, must condemn
			one group in order to unite the others, originate from low motives
			and therefore lead in the course of time to humiliation.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> He
				hides weapons in the thicket;<br /> He climbs the high hill in
				front of it.<br /> For three years he does not rise up.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Here fellowship has changed about to mistrust.&nbsp; Each man
			distrusts the other, plans a secret ambush, and seeks to spy on his
			fellow from afar.&nbsp; We are dealing with an obstinate opponent
			whom we cannot come at by this method.&nbsp; Obstacles standing in
			the way of fellowship with others are shown here.&nbsp; One has
			mental reservations for one&rsquo;s own part and seeks to take his
			opponent by surprise.&nbsp; This very fact makes one mistrustful,
			suspecting the same wiles in his opponent and trying to ferret them
			out.&nbsp; The result is that one departs further and further from
			true fellowship.&nbsp; The longer this goes on, the more alienated
			one becomes.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br /> He
				climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.<br /> Good fortune.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Here the reconciliation that follows quarrel moves
			nearer.&nbsp; It is true that there are still dividing walls on which
			we stand confronting one another.&nbsp; But the difficulties are too
			great.&nbsp; We get into straits, and this brings us to our
			senses.&nbsp; We cannot fight, and therein lies our good fortune.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br /> Men
				bound in fellowship first weep and lament,<br /> But afterward they
				laugh.<br /> After great struggles they succeed in meeting.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Two people are outwardly separated, but in their hearts they
			are united.&nbsp; They are kept apart by their positions in
			life.&nbsp; Many difficulties and obstructions arise between them and
			cause them grief.&nbsp; But, remaining true to each other, the allow
			nothing to separate them, and although it costs them a severe
			struggle to overcome the obstacles, they will succeed.&nbsp; When
			they come together their sadness will change to joy.&nbsp; Confucius
			says of this: <br /> <br /> <span class="quote"> <!-- open quote -->
				Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings.<br /> Now
				the course is checked, now it runs straight again.<br /> Here
				winged thoughts may pour freely forth in words,<br /> There the
				heavy burden of knowledge must be shut away in silence.<br /> But
				when two people are at one in their inmost hearts,<br /> They
				shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze.<br /> And when two
				people understand each other in their inmost hearts,<br /> Their
				words are sweet and strong, like the fragrance of orchids.<br />
			</span>
			<!-- closes quote -->
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Nine <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> Fellowship
				with men in the meadow.<br /> No remorse.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The warm attachment that springs from the heart is lacking
			here.&nbsp; We are by this time actually outside of fellowship with
			others.&nbsp; However, we ally ourselves with them.&nbsp; The
			fellowship does not include all, but only those who happen to dwell
			near one another.&nbsp; The meadow is the pasture at the entrance to
			the town.&nbsp; At this stage, the ultimate goal of the union of
			mankind has not yet been attained, but we need not reproach
			ourselves.&nbsp; We join the community without separate aims of our
			own.

			</i>K&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
		</p>
		<p>This hexagram is made up of the trigrams K&ecirc;n Keeping
			Still, mountain, and K&rsquo;un.&nbsp; The mountain is the youngest
			son of the Creative, the representative of heaven and earth.&nbsp; It
			dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain that gather
			round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with heavenly
			light.&nbsp; This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great
			and strong men.&nbsp; K&rsquo;un, the earth, stands above.&nbsp;
			Lowliness is a quality of the earth: this is the very reason why it
			appears in this hexagram as exalted, by being placed above the
			mountain.&nbsp; This shows how modesty functions in lowly, simple
			people: they are lifted up by it.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			MODESTY creates success.<br /> The superior man carries things
			through.<br />
		</p>
		<p>It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full
			what is modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to
			the law of heaven, turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises
			toward a new dawn.&nbsp; In obedience to the same law, the moon when
			it is full begins to wane, and when empty of light it waxes
			again.&nbsp; This heavenly law works itself out in the fates of men
			also.&nbsp; It is the law of earth to alter the full and to
			contribute to the modest.&nbsp; High mountains are worn down by the
			waters, and the valleys are filled up.&nbsp; It is the law of fate to
			undermine what is full and to prosper the modest.&nbsp; And men also
			hate fullness and love the modest.</p>
		<p>The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must
			fulfill themselves.&nbsp; But man has it in his power to shape his
			fate, according as his behavior exposes him to the influence of
			benevolent or of destructive forces.&nbsp; When a man holds a high
			position and is nevertheless modest, he shines with the light of
			wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot be
			passed by.&nbsp; Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the
			end without boasting of what he has achieved.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			Within the earth, a mountain:<br /> The image of MODESTY.<br />
			Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,<br /> And
			augments that which is too little.<br /> He weighs things and makes
			them equal.<br />
		</p>
		<p>The wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not
			visible to the eye, because the depths are offset by the height of
			the mountain.&nbsp; Thus high and low complement each other, and the
			result is the plain.&nbsp; Here an effect that it took a long time to
			achieve, but that in the end seems easy of accomplishment and
			self&ndash;evident, is used as the image of modesty.&nbsp; The
			superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the
			world; he equalizes the extremes that are the source of social
			discontent and thereby creates just and equable conditions.</p>



		
		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> A
				superior man modest about his modesty<br /> May cross the great
				water.<br /> Good fortune.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A dangerous enterprise, such as the crossing of a great
			stream, is made much more difficult if many claims and considerations
			have to be taken into account.&nbsp; On the other hand, the task is
			easy if it is attended to quickly and simply.&nbsp; Therefore the
			unassuming attitude of mind that goes with modesty fits a man to
			accomplish even difficult undertakings: he imposes no demands or
			stipulations but settles matters easily and quickly.&nbsp; Where no
			claims are put forward, no resistances arise.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Modesty that comes to expression.<br /> Perseverance brings good
				fortune.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			&ldquo;Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth
			speaketh.&rdquo;&nbsp; When a man&rsquo;s attitude of mind is so
			modest that this expresses itself in his outward behavior, it is a
			source of good fortune to him.&nbsp; For the possibility of exerting
			a lasting influence arises of itself, and no one can interfere.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br /> A
				superior man of modesty and merit<br /> Carries things to
				conclusion.<br /> Good fortune.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This is the center of the hexagram, where its secret is
			disclosed.&nbsp; A distinguished name is readily earned by great
			achievements.&nbsp; If a man allows himself to be dazzled by fame, he
			will soon be criticized, and difficulties will arise.&nbsp; If, on
			the contrary, he remains modest despite his merit, he makes himself
			beloved and wins the support necessary for carrying his work through
			to the end.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br />
				Nothing that would not further modesty<br /> In movement.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Everything has its proper measure.&nbsp; Even modesty in
			behavior can be carried too far.&nbsp; Here, however, it is
			appropriate, because the place between a worthy helper below and a
			kindly ruler above carries great responsibility.&nbsp; The confidence
			of the man in superior place must not be abused nor the merits of the
			man in inferior place concealed.&nbsp; There are officials who indeed
			do not strive for prominence; they hide behind the letter of
			ordinances, decline all responsibility, accept pay without giving its
			equivalent in work, and bear empty titles.&nbsp; This is the opposite
			of what is meant here by modesty.&nbsp; In such a position, modesty
			is shown by interest in one&rsquo;s work.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br /> No
				boasting of wealth before one&rsquo;s neighbor.<br /> It is
				favorable to attack with force.<br /> Nothing that would not
				further.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Modesty is not to be confused with weak good nature that lets
			things take their own course.&nbsp; When a man holds a responsible
			position, he must at times resort to energetic measures.&nbsp; In
			doing so he must not try to make an impression by boasting of his
			superiority but must make certain of the people around him.&nbsp; The
			measures taken should be purely objective and in no way personally
			offensive.&nbsp; Thus modesty manifests itself even in severity.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> Modesty that
				comes to expression.<br /> It is favorable to set armies marching<br />
				To chastise one&rsquo;s own city and one&rsquo;s country.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A person who is really sincere in his modesty must make it
			show in reality.&nbsp; He must proceed with great energy in
			this.&nbsp; When enmity arises nothing is easier than to lay the
			blame on another.&nbsp; A weak man takes offense perhaps, and draws
			back, feeling self&ndash;pity; he thinks that it is modesty that
			keeps him from defending himself.&nbsp; Genuine modesty sets one to
			creating order and inspires one to begin by disciplining one&rsquo;s
			own ego and one&rsquo;s immediate circle.&nbsp; Only through having
			the courage to marshal one&rsquo;s armies against oneself, will
			something forceful really be achieved.

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
		</p>
		<p>The strong line in the fourth place, that of the leading
			official, meets with response and obedience from all the other lines,
			which are all weak.&nbsp; The attribute of the upper trigram,
			Ch&ecirc;n, is movement; the attributes of K&rsquo;un, the lower, are
			obedience and devotion.&nbsp; This begins a movement that meets with
			devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm, carrying all with
			it.&nbsp; Of great importance, furthermore, is the law of movement
			along the line of least resistance, which in this hexagram is
			enunciated as the law for natural events and for human life.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			ENTHUSIASM.&nbsp; It furthers one to install helpers<br /> And to
			set armies marching.
		</p>
		<p>The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at
			hand an eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people
			and acts in accord with it.&nbsp; Hence he finds universal and
			willing obedience.&nbsp; To arouse enthusiasm it is necessary for a
			man to adjust himself and his ordinances to the character of those
			whom he has to lead.&nbsp; The inviolability of natural laws rests on
			this principle of movement along the line of least resistance.&nbsp;
			These laws are not forces external to things but represent the
			harmony of movement immanent in them.&nbsp; That is why the celestial
			bodies do not deviate from their orbits and why all events in nature
			occur with fixed regularity.&nbsp; It is the same with human society:
			only such laws as are rooted in popular sentiment can be enforced,
			while laws violating this sentiment merely arouse resentment.</p>
		<p>Again, it is enthusiasm that enables us to install helpers for
			the completion of an undertaking without fear of secret
			opposition.&nbsp; It is enthusiasm too that can unify mass movements,
			as in war, so that they achieve victory.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:<br /> The image of
			ENTHUSIASM.<br /> Thus the ancient kings made music<br /> In order
			to honor merit,<br /> And offered it with splendor<br /> To the
			Supreme Deity,<br /> Inviting their ancestors to be present.<br />
		</p>
		<p>When, at the beginning of summer, thunder&mdash;electrical
			energy&mdash;comes rushing forth from the earth again, and the first
			thunderstorm refreshes nature, a prolonged state of tension is
			resolved.&nbsp; Joy and relief make themselves felt.&nbsp; So too,
			music has power to ease tension within the heart and to loosen the
			grip of obscure emotions.&nbsp; The enthusiasm of the heart expresses
			itself involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic
			movement of the body.&nbsp; From immemorial times the inspiring
			effect of the invisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them
			together, has mystified mankind.</p>
		<p>Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they
			elevated and regulated it.&nbsp; Music was looked upon as something
			serious and holy, designed to purify the feelings of men.&nbsp; It
			fell to music to glorify the virtues of heroes and thus to construct
			a bridge to the world of the unseen.&nbsp; In the temple men drew
			near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later the theater
			developed).&nbsp; Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was
			united with the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for
			the ancestors.&nbsp; The ancestors were invited to these divine
			services as guests of the Ruler of Heaven and as representatives of
			humanity in the higher regions.&nbsp; This uniting of the human past
			with the Divinity in solemn moments of religious inspiration
			established the bond between God and man.&nbsp; The ruler who revered
			the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of
			Heaven, in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical
			contact.</p>
		<p>These ideas are the final summation of Chinese culture.&nbsp;
			Confucius has said of the great sacrifice at which these rites were
			performed: &ldquo;He who could wholly comprehend this sacrifice could
			rule the world as though it were spinning on his hand.&rdquo;</p>

			neglects those beneath him; he is as firm as a rock.&nbsp; When the

				beginning of movement, the first trace of good fortune (or
				misfortune) that shows itself.&nbsp; The superior man perceives the
				seeds and immediately takes action.&nbsp; He does not wait even a

			This line is the opposite of the preceding one: the latter

		<p>The trigram Tui, the Joyous, whose attribute is gladness, is

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			FOLLOWING has supreme success.<br /> Perseverance furthers.&nbsp; No
			blame.
		</p>
		<p>In order to obtain a following one must first know how to adapt
			oneself.&nbsp; If a man would rule he must first learn to serve, for
			only in this way does he secure from those below him the joyous
			assent that is necessary if they are to follow him.&nbsp; If he has
			to obtain a following by force or cunning, by conspiracy or by
			creating factions, he invariably arouses resistance, which obstructs
			willing adherence.&nbsp; But even joyous movement can lead to evil
			consequences, hence the added stipulation, &ldquo;Perseverance
			furthers&rdquo;&mdash;that is, consistency in doing
			right&mdash;together with &ldquo;No blame.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just as we
			should not ask others to follow us unless this condition is
			fulfilled, so it is only under this condition that we can in turn
			follow others without coming to harm.</p>
		<p>The thought of obtaining a following through adaptation to the

		<p>In the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and
			rests.&nbsp; Here it is the thunder in the middle of the lake that
			serves as the image&mdash;thunder in its winter rest, not thunder in
			motion.&nbsp; The idea of following in the sense of adaptation to the
			demands of the time grows out of this image.&nbsp; Thunder in the
			middle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest.&nbsp;
			Similarly, a superior man, after being tirelessly active all day,
			allows himself rest and recuperation at night.&nbsp; No situation can

		</ul>
		<p>
			There are exceptional conditions in which the relation
			between leader and followers changes.&nbsp; It is implicit in the
			idea of following and adaptation that if one wants to lead others,
			one must remain accessible and responsive to the views of those under
			him.&nbsp; At the same time, however, he must have firm principles,
			so that he does not vacillate where there is only a question of
			current opinion.&nbsp; Once we are ready to listen to the opinions of
			others, we must not associate exclusively with people who share our
			views or with members of our own party; instead, we must go out and
			mingle freely with all sorts of people, friends or foes.&nbsp; That

			It often happens, when a man exerts a certain amount of

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE GENTLE, WIND
		</p>
		<p>
			The Chinese character <i>ku</i> represents a bowl in whose contents
			worms are breeding.&nbsp; This means decay.&nbsp; It is come about
			because the gentle indifference in the lower trigram has come
			together with the rigid inertia of the upper, and the result is
			stagnation.&nbsp; Since this implies guilt, the conditions embody a
			demand for removal of the cause.&nbsp; Hence the meaning of the
			hexagram is not simply &ldquo;what has been spoiled&rdquo; but
			&ldquo;work on what has been spoiled.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED<br /> Has supreme success.<br /> It

		<p>
			What has been spoiled through man&rsquo;s fault can be made good
			again through man&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; It is not immutable fate, as in
			the time of <a class="inlineRef" href="#12" title="hexagram #12">STANDSTILL</a>,
			that has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of
			human freedom.&nbsp; Work toward improving conditions promises well,
			because it accords the possibilities of the time.&nbsp; We must not
			recoil from work and danger&mdash;symbolized by crossing of the great
			water&mdash;but must take hold energetically.&nbsp; Success depends,
			however, on proper deliberation.&nbsp; This is expressed by the
			lines, &ldquo;Before the starting point, three days.&nbsp; After the
			starting point, three days.&rdquo;&nbsp; We must first know the
			causes of corruption before we can do away with them; hence it is
			necessary to be cautious during the time before the start.&nbsp; Then
			we must see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that a
			relapse may be avoided; therefore we must pay attention to the time
			after the start.&nbsp; Decisiveness and energy must take the place of
			inertia and indifference that have led to decay, in order that the
			ending may be followed by a new beginning.

		</p>
		<p>When the wind blows low on the mountain, it is thrown back and
			spoils the vegetation.&nbsp; This contains a challenge to
			improvement.&nbsp; It is the same with debasing attitudes and
			fashions; they corrupt human society.&nbsp; His methods likewise must
			be derived from the two trigrams, but in such a way that their
			effects unfold in orderly sequence.&nbsp; The superior man must first
			remove stagnation by stirring up public opinion, as the wind stirs
			everything, and must strengthen and tranquillize the character of the
			people, as the mountain gives tranquillity and nourishment to all
			that grows in its vicinity.</p>

		</ul>
		<p>
			Rigid adherence to tradition has resulted in decay.&nbsp; But
			the decay has not yet penetrated deeply and so can still be easily
			remedied.&nbsp; It is as if a son were compensating for the decay his
			father allowed to creep in.&nbsp; Then no blame attaches to the

		<p>
			This refers to mistakes that as a result of weakness have
			brought about decay&mdash;hence the symbol, &ldquo;what has been

			This describes a man who proceeds a little too energetically

			result, minor discords and annoyances will surely develop.&nbsp; But
			too much energy is better than too little.&nbsp; Therefore, although

			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE JOYOUS, LAKE
		</p>
		<p>
			The Chinese word <i>lin</i> has a range of meanings that is not
			exhausted by any single word of another language.&nbsp; The ancient
			explanations in the Book of Changes give as its first meaning,
			&ldquo;becoming great.&rdquo;&nbsp; What becomes great are the two
			strong lines growing into the hexagram from below; the
			light&ndash;giving power expands with them.&nbsp; The meaning is then
			further extended to include the concept of approach, especially the
			approach of what is strong and highly placed in relation to what is
			lower.&nbsp; Finally the meaning includes the attitude of
			condescension of a man in high position toward the people, and in
			general the setting to work on affairs.&nbsp; This hexagram is linked
			with the twelfth month (January&ndash;February), when, after the
			winter solstice, the light power begins to ascend again.
		</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			APPROACH has supreme success.<br /> Perseverance furthers.<br />
			When the eighth month comes,<br /> There will be misfortune.
		</p>
		<p>The hexagram as a whole points to a time of joyous, hopeful
			progress.&nbsp; Spring is approaching.&nbsp; Joy and forbearance
			bring high and low nearer together.&nbsp; Success is certain.&nbsp;
			But we must work with determination and perseverance to make full use
			of the propitiousness of the time.&nbsp; And one thing more: spring
			does not last forever.&nbsp; In the eighth month the aspects are
			reversed.&nbsp; Then only two strong, light lines are left; these do
			not advance but are in retreat (see next hexagram).&nbsp; We must
			take heed of this change in good time.&nbsp; If we meet evil before
			it becomes reality&mdash;before it has even begun to stir&mdash;we
			can master it.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			The earth above the lake:<br /> The image of APPROACH.<br /> Thus
			the superior man is inexhaustible<br /> In his will to teach,<br />
			And without limits<br /> In his tolerance and protection of the
			people.<br />
		</p>
		<p>The earth borders upon the lake from above.&nbsp; This
			symbolizes the approach and condescension of the man of higher
			position to those beneath him.&nbsp; The two parts of the image
			indicate what his attitude toward these people will be.&nbsp; Just as
			the lake is inexhaustible in depth, so the sage is inexhaustible in
			his readiness to teach mankind, and just as the earth is boundlessly
			wide, sustaining and caring for all creatures on it, so the sage
			sustains and cares for all people and excludes no part of humanity.</p>

		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> Joint

		</ul>
		<p>
			The good begins to prevail and to find response in
			influential circles.&nbsp; This in turn is an incentive to men of
			ability.&nbsp; It is well to join this upward trend, but we must not
			let ourselves be carried away by the current of the time; we must
			adhere perseveringly to what is right.&nbsp; This bring good fortune.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Joint approach.<br /> Good fortune.<br /> Everything furthers.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			When the stimulus to approach comes from a high place, and
			when a man has the inner strength and consistency that need no
			admonition, good fortune will ensue.&nbsp; Nor need the future cause
			any concern.&nbsp; He is well aware that everything earthly is
			transitory, and that a descent follows upon every rise, but need not
			be confused by this universal law of fate.&nbsp; Everything serves to
			further.&nbsp; Therefore he will travel the paths of life swiftly,

		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br />
				Comfortable approach.<br /> Nothing that would further.<br /> If
				one is induced to grieve over it,<br /> One becomes free of blame.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Things are going well for a man: he achieves power and
			influence.&nbsp; But in this lies the danger that he may relax, and
			confident of his position, allow the easygoing, careless mood to show
			itself in his dealings with other people.&nbsp; This would inevitably
			be harmful.&nbsp; But there is possibility of a change of mood.&nbsp;
			If he regrets his mistaken attitude and feels the responsibility of
			an influential position, he frees himself of faults.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br />
				Complete approach.<br /> No blame.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			While the three lower lines indicate rise to power and
			influence, the three upper lines show the attitude of persons in
			higher position toward those of lower rank for whom they procure
			influence.&nbsp; Here is shown the open&ndash;minded approach of a
			person of high rank to a man of ability whom he draws in to his own
			circle, regardless of class prejudice.&nbsp; This is very favorable.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br /> Wise
				approach.<br /> This is right for a great prince.<br /> Good

		</ul>
		<p>
			A prince, or anyone in a leading position, must have the
			wisdom to attract to himself people of ability who are expert in
			directing affairs.&nbsp; His wisdom consists both in selecting the
			right people and in allowing those chosen to have a free hand without
			interference from him.&nbsp; For only through such
			self&ndash;restraint will he find the experts needed to satisfy all
			of his requirements.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> Great hearted

		</ul>
		<p>
			A sage who has put the world behind him and who in spirit has
			already withdrawn from life may, under certain circumstances, decide
			to return once more to the here and now and to approach other
			men.&nbsp; This means great good fortune for the men whom he teaches
			and helps.&nbsp; And for him this great hearted humbling of himself
			is blameless.

				title="upper trigram for Kuan" alt="&#9780;" /><i>above</i> SUN
			&nbsp;/&nbsp; THE GENTLE, WIND <br /> <img src="images/kun.gif"
				width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Kuan" alt="&#9783;" /><i>below
			</i>K&rsquo;UN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
		</p>
		<p>A slight variation of tonal stress gives the Chinese name for
			this hexagram a double meaning.&nbsp; It means both contemplating and
			being seen, in the sense of being an example.&nbsp; These ideas are
			suggested by the fact that the hexagram can be understood as
			picturing a type of tower characteristic of ancient China.</p>
		<p>A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at
			the same time, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that
			could be seen for miles around.&nbsp; Thus the hexagram shows a ruler
			who contemplates the law of heaven above him and the ways of the
			people below, and who, by means of good government, sets a lofty
			example to the masses.</p>
		<p>This hexagram is linked with the eight month
			(September&ndash;October).&nbsp; The light&ndash;giving power
			retreats and the dark power is again on the increase.&nbsp; However,
			this aspect is not material in the interpretation of the hexagram as
			a whole.</p>

		<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
		<p class="judgSub">
			CONTEMPLATION.&nbsp; The ablution has been made,<br /> But not yet
			the offering.<br /> Full of trust they look up to him.
		</p>
		<p>The sacrificial ritual in China began with an ablution and a
			libation by which the Deity was invoked, after which the sacrifice
			was offered.&nbsp; The moment of time between these two ceremonies is
			the most sacred of all, the moment of deepest inner
			concentration.&nbsp; If piety is sincere and expressive of real
			faith, the contemplation of it has a transforming and
			awe&ndash;inspiring effect on those who witness it.</p>
		<p>Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the
			fact that natural occurrences are uniformly subject to law.&nbsp;
			Contemplation of the divine meaning underlying the workings of the
			universe gives to the man who is called upon to influence others the
			means of producing like effects.&nbsp; This requires that power of
			inner concentration which religious contemplation develops in great
			men strong in faith.&nbsp; It enables them to apprehend the
			mysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of profoundest inner
			concentration they give expression to these laws in their own
			persons.&nbsp; Thus a hidden spiritual power emanates from them,
			influencing and dominating others without their being aware of how it
			happens.</p>

		<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
		<p class="imageSub">
			The wind blows over the earth:<br /> The image of CONTEMPLATION.<br />
			Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,<br />
			Contemplated the people,<br /> And gave them instruction.<br />
		</p>
		<p>When the wind blows over the earth it goes far and wide, and
			the grass must bend to its power.&nbsp; These two occurrences find
			confirmation in the hexagram.&nbsp; The two images are used to
			symbolize a practice of the kings of old; in making regular journeys
			the ruler could, in the first place, survey his realm and make
			certain that none of the existing usages of the people escaped
			notice; in the second, he could exert influence through which such
			customs as were unsuitable could be changed.</p>
		<p>All of this points to the power possessed by a superior
			personality.&nbsp; On the one hand, such a man will have a view of
			the real sentiments of the great mass of humanity and therefore
			cannot be deceived; on the other, he will impress the people so
			profoundly, by his mere existence and by the impact of his
			personality, that they will be swayed by him as the grass by the
			wind.</p>



		
		<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six at <strong>the beginning</strong> means:<br /> Boylike
				contemplation.<br /> For an inferior man, no blame.<br /> For a
				superior man, humiliation.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This means contemplation from a distance, without
			comprehension.&nbsp; A man of influence is at hand, but his influence
			is not understood by the common people.&nbsp; This matters little in
			the case of the masses, for they benefit by the actions of the ruling
			sage whether they understand them or not.&nbsp; But for a superior
			man it is a disgrace.&nbsp; He must not content himself with a
			shallow, thoughtless view of prevailing forces; he must contemplate
			them as a connected whole and try to understand them.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>second place</strong> means:<br />
				Contemplation through the crack of the door.<br /> Furthering for
				the perseverance of a woman.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Through the crack of the door one has a limited outlook; one
			looks outward from within.&nbsp; Contemplation is subjectively
			limited.&nbsp; One tends to relate everything to oneself and cannot
			put oneself in another&rsquo;s place and understand his
			motives.&nbsp; This is appropriate for a good housewife.&nbsp; It is
			not necessary for her to be conversant with the affairs of the
			world.&nbsp; But for a man who must take active part in public life,
			such a narrow, egotistic way of contemplating things is of course
			harmful.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>third place</strong> means:<br />
				Contemplation of my life<br /> Decides the choice<br /> Between
				advance and retreat.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This is the place of transition.&nbsp; We no longer look
			outward to receive pictures that are more or less limited and
			confused, but direct our contemplation upon ourselves in order to
			find a guideline for our decisions.&nbsp; This
			self&ndash;contemplation means the overcoming of naive egotism in the
			person who sees everything solely from his own standpoint.&nbsp; He
			begins to reflect and in this way acquires objectivity.&nbsp;
			However, self&ndash;knowledge does not mean preoccupation with
			one&rsquo;s own thoughts; rather, it means concern about the effects
			one creates.&nbsp; It is only the effects our lives produce that give
			us the right to judge whether what we have done means progress or
			regression.
		</p>
		<ul class="notRuler">
			<li>Six in the <strong>fourth place</strong> means:<br />
				Contemplation of the light of the kingdom.<br /> It furthers one to
				exert influence as the guest of a king.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This describes a man who understands the secrets by which a
			kingdom can be made to flourish.&nbsp; Such a man must be given an
			authoritative position, in which he can exert influence.&nbsp; He
			should be, so to speak, a guest&mdash;that is, he should be honored
			and allowed to act independently, and should not be used as a tool.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine in the <strong>fifth place</strong> means:<br />
				Contemplation of my life.<br /> The superior man is without blame.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A man in an authoritative position to whom others look up
			must always be ready for self&ndash;examination.&nbsp; The right sort
			of self&ndash;examination, however, consists not in idle brooding
			over oneself but in examining the effects one produces.&nbsp; Only
			when these effects are good, and when one&rsquo;s influence on others
			is good, will the contemplation of one&rsquo;s own life bring the
			satisfaction of knowing oneself to be free of mistakes.
		</p>
		<ul class="govRuler">
			<li>Nine <strong>at the top</strong> means:<br /> Contemplation
				of his life.<br /> The superior man is without blame.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			While the preceding line represents a man who contemplates
			himself, here in the highest place everything that is personal,
			related to the ego, is excluded.&nbsp; The picture is that of a sage
			who stands outside the affairs of the world.&nbsp; Liberated from his
			ego, he contemplates the laws of life and so realizes that knowing
			how to become free of blame is the highest good.
