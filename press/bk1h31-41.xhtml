<h2>31.&nbsp; Hsien / Influence (Wooing)</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
	<img src="images/tui.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Hsien" alt="&#9777;" /><i>above</i> TUI &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE JOYOUS, LAKE
	<br /><img src="images/ken.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Hsien" alt="&#9782;" /><i>below </i>K&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
</p>
<p>
	The name of the hexagram means &ldquo;universal,&rdquo; &ldquo;general,&rdquo; and in a figurative sense &ldquo;to influence,&rdquo; &ldquo;to stimulate.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous; the lower is K&ecirc;n, Keeping Still.&nbsp;
	By its persistent, quiet influence, the lower, rigid trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds to this stimulation cheerfully and joyously.&nbsp;
	K&ecirc;n, the lower trigram, is the youngest son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter.&nbsp;
	Thus the universal mutual attraction between the sexes is represented.&nbsp;
	In courtship, the masculine principle must seize the initiative and place itself below the feminine principle.
</p>
<p>
	Just as the first part of book I begins with the hexagrams of heaven and earth, the foundations of all that exists, the second part begins with the hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the foundations of all social relationships.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	Influence.&nbsp; Success.<br />
	Perseverance furthers.<br />
	To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.
</p>
<p>
	The weak element is above, the strong below; hence their powers attract each other, so that they unite.&nbsp;
	This brings about success, for all success depends on the effect of mutual attraction.&nbsp;
	By keeping still within while experiencing joy without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess and hold it within proper bounds.&nbsp;
	This is the meaning of the added admonition, &ldquo;Perseverance furthers,&rdquo; for it is perseverance that makes the difference between seduction and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a position inferior to that of the weak girl and shows consideration for her.&nbsp;
	This attraction between affinities is a general law of nature.&nbsp;
	Heaven and earth attract each other and thus all creatures come into being.&nbsp;
	Through such attraction the sage influences men&rsquo;s hearts, and thus the world attains peace.&nbsp;
	From the attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	A lake on the mountain:<br />
	The image of influence.<br />
	Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him<br />
	By his readiness to receive them.
</p>
<p>
	A mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the moisture from the lake.&nbsp;
	It has this advantage because its summit does not jut out as a peak but is sunken.&nbsp;
	The image counsels that the mind should be kept humble and free, so that it may remain receptive to good advice.&nbsp;
	People soon give up counseling a man who thinks that he knows everything better than anyone else.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	The influence shows itself in the big toe.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A movement, before it is actually carried out, shows itself first in the toes.&nbsp;
	The idea of an influence is already present, but is not immediately apparent to others.&nbsp;
	As long as the intention has no visible effect, it is of no importance to the outside world and leads neither to good nor to evil.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	The influence shows itself in the calves of the legs.<br />
	Misfortune.<br />
	Tarrying brings good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In movement, the calf of the leg follows the foot; by itself it can neither go forward nor stand still.&nbsp;
	Since the movement is not self&ndash;governed, it bodes ill.&nbsp;
	One should wait quietly until one is impelled to action by a real influence.&nbsp;
	Then one remains uninjured.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	The influence shows itself in the thighs.<br />
	Holds to that which follows it.<br />
	To continue is humiliating.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Every mood of the heart influences us to movement.&nbsp;
	What the heart desires, the thighs run after without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation; they hold to the heart, which they follow.&nbsp;
	In the life of man, however, acting on the spur of every caprice is wrong and if continued leads to humiliation.&nbsp;
	Three considerations suggest themselves here.&nbsp;
	First, a man should not run precipitately after all the persons whom he would like to influence, but must be able to hold back under certain circumstances.&nbsp;
	As little should he yield immediately to every whim of those in whose service he stands.&nbsp;
	Finally, where the moods of his own heart are concerned, he should never ignore the possibility of inhibition, for this is the basis of human freedom.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Perseverance brings good fortune.<br />
	Remorse disappears.<br />
	If a man is agitated in mind,<br />
	And his thoughts go hither and thither,<br />
	Only those friends<br />
	On whom he fixes his conscious thoughts<br />
	Will follow.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Here the place of the heart is reached.&nbsp;
	The impulse that springs from this source is the most important of all.&nbsp;
	It is of particular concern that this influence be constant and good; then, in spite of the danger arising from the great susceptibility of the human heart, there will be no cause for remorse.&nbsp;
	When the quiet power of a man&rsquo;s own character is at work, the effects produced are right.&nbsp;
	All those who are receptive to the vibrations of such a spirit will then be influenced.&nbsp;
	Influence over others should not express itself as a conscious and willed effort to manipulate them.&nbsp;
	Through practicing such conscious incitement, one becomes wrought up and is exhausted by the eternal stress and strain.&nbsp;
	Moreover, the effects produced are then limited to those on whom one&rsquo;s thoughts are consciously fixed.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	The influence shows itself in the back of the neck.<br />
	No remorse.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The back of the neck is the most rigid part of the body.&nbsp;
	When the influence shows itself there, the will remains firm and the influence does not lead to confusion.&nbsp;
	Hence remorse does not enter into consideration here.&nbsp;
	What takes place in the depths of one&rsquo;s being, in the unconscious, can neither be called forth nor prevented by the unconscious mind.&nbsp;
	It is true that if we cannot be influenced ourselves, we cannot influence the outside world.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	The influence shows itself in the jaws, cheeks, and tongue.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The most superficial way of trying to influence others is through talk that has nothing real behind it.&nbsp;
	The influence produced by such mere tongue wagging must necessarily remain insignificant.&nbsp;
	Hence no indication is added regarding good or bad fortune.

<h2>32.&nbsp; H&ecirc;ng / Duration</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
	<img src="images/chen.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for H&ecirc;ng" alt="&#9779;" /><i>above</i> CH&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE AROUSING, THUNDER
	<br /><img src="images/sun.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for H&ecirc;ng" alt="&#9780;" /><i>below </i>SUN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE GENTLE, WIND
</p>
<p>
	The strong trigram Ch&ecirc;n is above, the weak trigram Sun below.&nbsp;
	This hexagram is the inverse of the preceding one.&nbsp;
	In the latter we have influence, here we have union as an enduring condition.&nbsp;
	The two images are thunder and wind, which are likewise constantly paired phenomena.&nbsp;
	The lower trigram indicates gentleness within; the upper, movement without.
</p>
<p>
	In the sphere of social relationships, the hexagram represents the institution of marriage as the enduring union of the sexes.&nbsp;
	During courtship the young man subordinates himself to the girl, but in marriage, which is represented by the coming together of the eldest son and the eldest daughter, the husband is the directing and moving force outside, while the wife, inside, is gentle and submissive.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	DURATION.&nbsp; Success.&nbsp; No blame.<br />
	Perseverance furthers.<br />
	It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
</p>
<p>
	Duration is a state whose movement is not worn down by hindrances.&nbsp;
	It is not a state of rest, for mere standstill is regression.&nbsp;
	Duration is rather the self&ndash;contained and therefore self&ndash;renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending.&nbsp;
	The end is reached by an inward movement, by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this movement turns into a new beginning, in which the movement is directed outward, in exhalation, diastole, expansion.
</p>
<p>
	Heavenly bodies exemplify duration.&nbsp;
	They move in their fixed orbits, and because of this their light&ndash;giving power endures.&nbsp;
	The seasons of the year follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence can produce effects that endure.
</p>
<p>
	So likewise the dedicated man embodies an enduring meaning in his way of life, and thereby the world is formed.&nbsp;
	In that which gives things their duration, we can come to understand the nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION.<br />
	Thus the superior man stands firm<br />
	And does not change his direction.
</p>
<p>
	Thunder rolls, and the wind blows; both are examples of extreme mobility and so are seemingly the very opposite of duration, but the laws governing their appearance and subsidence, their coming and going, endure.&nbsp;
	In the same way the independence of the superior man is not based on rigidity and immobility of character.&nbsp;
	He always keeps abreast of the time and changes with it.&nbsp;
	What endures is the unswerving directive, the inner law of his being, which determines all his actions.
</p>

<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.<br />
	Nothing that would further.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Whatever endures can be created only gradually by long&ndash;continued work and careful reflection.&nbsp;
	In the same sense Lao&ndash;tse says: &ldquo;If we wish to compress something, we must first let it fully expand."&nbsp;
	He who demands too much at once is acting precipitately, and because he attempts too much, he ends by succeeding in nothing.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	Remorse disappears.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The situation is abnormal.&nbsp;
	A man&rsquo;s force of character is greater than the available material power.&nbsp;
	Thus he might be afraid of allowing himself to attempt something beyond his strength.&nbsp;
	However, since it is the time of DURATION, it is possible for him to control his inner strength and so to avoid excess.&nbsp;
	Cause for remorse then disappears.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	He who does not give duration to his character<br />
	Meets with disgrace.<br />
	Persistent humiliation.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	If a man remains at the mercy of moods of hope or fear aroused by the outer world, he loses his inner consistency of character.&nbsp;
	Such inconsistency invariably leads to distressing experiences.&nbsp;
	These humiliations often come from an unforeseen quarter.&nbsp;
	Such experiences are not merely effects produced by the external world, but logical consequences evoked by his own nature.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	No game in the field.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	If we are in pursuit of game and want to get a shot at a quarry, we must set about it in the right way.&nbsp;
	A man who persists in stalking game in a place where there is none may wait forever without finding any.&nbsp;
	Persistence in search is not enough.&nbsp;
	What is not sought in the right way is not found.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Giving duration to one&rsquo;s character through perseverance.<br />
	This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	A woman should follow a man her whole life long, but a man should at all times hold to what is his duty at the given moment.&nbsp;
	Should he persistently seek to conform to the woman, it would be a mistake for him.&nbsp;
	Accordingly it is altogether right for a woman to hold conservatively to tradition, but a man must always be flexible and adaptable and allow himself to be guided solely by what his duty requires of him at the moment.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	There are people who live in a state of perpetual hurry without ever attaining inner composure.&nbsp;
	Restlessness not only prevents all thoroughness but actually becomes a danger if it is dominant in places of authority.

<h2>33.&nbsp; Tun / Retreat</h2>

<p class="subTitle">
<img src="images/chien.gif" width="40" height="28" title="upper trigram for Tun" alt="&#9776;" /><i>above</i> CH&rsquo;IEN &nbsp;/&nbsp; THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
<br /><img src="images/ken.gif" width="40" height="28" title="lower trigram for Tun" alt="&#9782;" /><i>below </i>K&#202;N &nbsp;/&nbsp; KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
</p>
<p>
	The power of the dark is ascending.&nbsp;
	The light retreats to security, so that the dark cannot encroach upon it.&nbsp;
	This retreat is a matter not of man&rsquo;s will but of natural law.&nbsp;
	Therefore in this case withdrawal is proper; it is the correct way to behave in order not to exhaust one&rsquo;s forces.
</p>
<p>
	In the calendar this hexagram is linked with the sixth month (July&ndash;August), in which the forces of winter are already showing their influence.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	RETREAT.&nbsp; Success.<br />
	In what is small, perseverance furthers.
</p>
<p>
	Conditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time are advancing.&nbsp;
	In this case retreat is the right course, and it is through retreat that success is achieved.&nbsp;
	But success consists in being able to carry out the retreat correctly.&nbsp;
	Retreat is not to be confused with flight.&nbsp;
	Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances, whereas retreat is a sign of strength.&nbsp;
	We must be careful not to miss the right moment while we are in full possession of power and position.&nbsp;
	Then we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too late and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of being drawn into a desperate life&ndash;and&ndash;death struggle.&nbsp;
	Thus we do not simply abandon the field to the opponent; we make it difficult for him to advance by showing perseverance in single acts of resistance.&nbsp;
	In this way we prepare, while retreating, for the counter&ndash;movement.&nbsp;
	Understanding the laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is not easy.&nbsp;
	The meaning that lies hidden in such a time is important.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Mountain under heaven: the image of RETREAT.<br />
	Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,<br />
	Not angrily but with reserve.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally comes to a stop.&nbsp;
	Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into the distance and remains out of reach.&nbsp;
	This symbolizes the behavior of the superior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own thoughts as the inferior man comes forward.&nbsp;
	He does not hate him, for hatred is a form of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object.&nbsp;
	The superior man shows strength (heaven) in that he brings the inferior man to a standstill (mountain) by his dignified reserve.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="constRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	At the tail in retreat.&nbsp; This is dangerous.<br />
	One must not wish to undertake anything.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Since the hexagram is the picture of something that is retreating, the lowest line represents the tail and the top line the head.&nbsp;
	In a retreat it is advantageous to be at the front.&nbsp;
	Here one is at the back, in immediate contact with the pursuing enemy.&nbsp;
	This is dangerous, and under such circumstances it is not advisable to undertake anything.&nbsp;
	Keeping still is the easiest way of escaping from the threatening danger.
</p>



<ul class="constRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	He holds him fast with yellow oxhide.<br />
	No one can tear him loose.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Yellow is the color of the middle.&nbsp;
	It indicates that which is correct and in line with duty.&nbsp;
	Oxhide is strong and not to be torn.
<br /><br />
	While the superior men retreat and the inferior press after them, the inferior man represented here holds on so firmly and tightly to the superior men that the latter cannot shake him off.&nbsp;
	And because he is in quest of what is right and so strong in purpose, he reaches his goal.&nbsp;
	Thus the line confirms what is said in THE JUDGMENT: &ldquo;In what is small&rdquo;&mdash;here equivalent to &ldquo;in the inferior man&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;perseverance furthers.&rdquo;
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	A halted retreat<br />
	Is nerve&ndash;wracking and dangerous.<br />
	To retain people as men&ndash; and maidservants<br />
	Brings good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	When it is time to retreat it is both unpleasant and dangerous to be held back, because then one no longer has freedom of action.&nbsp;
	In such a case the only expedient is to take into one&rsquo;s service, so to speak, those who refuse to let one go, so that one may at least keep one&rsquo;s initiative and not fall helplessly under their domination.&nbsp;
	But even with this expedient the situation is far from satisfactory&mdash;for what can one hope to accomplish with such servants?
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man<br />
	And downfall to the inferior man.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In retreating the superior man is intent on taking his departure willingly and in all friendliness.&nbsp;
	He easily adjusts his mind to retreat, because in retreating he does not have to do violence to his convictions.&nbsp;
	The only one who suffers is the inferior man from whom he retreats, who will degenerate when deprived of the guidance of the superior man.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	Friendly retreat.&nbsp; Perseverance brings good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	It is the business of the superior man to recognize in time that the moment for retreat has come.&nbsp;
	If the right moment is chosen, the retreat can be carried out within the forms of perfect friendliness, without the necessity of disagreeable discussions.&nbsp;
	Yet, for all the observance of amenities, absolute firmness of decision is necessary if one is not to be led astray by irrelevant considerations.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	Cheerful retreat.&nbsp; Everything serves to further.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The situation is unequivocal.&nbsp;
	Inner detachment has become an established fact, and we are at liberty to depart.&nbsp;
	When one sees the way ahead thus clearly, free of all doubt, a cheerful mood sets in, and one chooses what is right without further thought.&nbsp;
	Such a clear path ahead always leads to the good.

<h2>34.&nbsp; Ta Chuang / The Power of the Great</h2>

<p class="subTitle">

</p>
<p>
	The great lines, that is, the light, strong lines, are powerful.&nbsp;
	Four light lines have entered the hexagram from below and are about to ascend higher.&nbsp;
	The upper trigram is Ch&ecirc;n, the Arousing; the lower is Ch&rsquo;ien, the Creative.&nbsp;
	Ch&rsquo;ien is strong, Ch&ecirc;n produces movement.&nbsp;
	The union of movement and strength gives the meaning of THE POWER OF THE GREAT.&nbsp;
	The hexagram is linked with the second month (March&ndash;April).
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	THE POWER OF THE GREAT.&nbsp; Perseverance furthers.
</p>
<p>
	The hexagram points to a time when inner worth mounts with great force and comes to power.&nbsp;
	But its strength has already passed beyond the median line, hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one&rsquo;s own power and forget to ask what is right.&nbsp;
	There is danger too that, being intent on movement, we may not wait for the right time.&nbsp;
	Therefore the added statement that perseverance furthers.&nbsp;
	For that is truly great power which does not degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental principles of right and of justice.&nbsp;
	When we understand this point&mdash;namely, that greatness and justice must be indissolubly united&mdash;we understand the true meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Thunder in heaven above:
	The image of THE POWER OF THE GREAT.<br />
	Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths<br />
	That do not accord with established order.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Thunder&mdash;electrical energy&mdash;mounts upward in the spring.&nbsp;
	The direction of this movement is in harmony with that of the movement of heaven.&nbsp;
	It is therefore a movement in accord with heaven, producing great power.&nbsp;
	However, true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right.&nbsp;
	Therefore in times of great power the superior man avoids doing anything that is not in harmony with the established order.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the beginning means:<br />
	Power in the toes.<br />
	Continuing brings misfortune.<br />
	This is certainly true.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The toes are in the lowest place and are ready to advance.&nbsp;
	So likewise great power in lowly station is inclined to effect advance by force.&nbsp;
	This, if carried further, would certainly lead to misfortune, and therefore by way of advice a warning is added.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	Perseverance brings good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The premise here is that the gates to success are beginning to open.&nbsp;
	Resistance gives way and we forge ahead.&nbsp;
	This is the point at which, only too easily, we become the prey of exuberant self&ndash;confidence.&nbsp;
	This is why the oracle says that perseverance (i.e., perseverance in inner equilibrium, without excessive use of power) brings good fortune.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />

	The superior man does not act thus.<br />
	To continue is dangerous.<br />
	A goat butts against a hedge<br />
	And gets its horns entangled.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Making a boast of power leads to entanglements, just as a goat entangles its horns when it butts against a hedge.&nbsp;
	Whereas an inferior man revels in power when he comes into possession of it, the superior man never makes this mistake.&nbsp;
	He is conscious at all times of the danger of pushing ahead regardless of circumstances, and therefore renounces in good time the empty display of force.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Perseverance brings good fortune.<br />
	Remorse disappears.<br />

<p>
	If a man goes on quietly and perseveringly working at the removal of resistances, success comes in the end.&nbsp;
	The obstructions give way and all occasion for remorse arising from excessive use of power disappears.
<br /><br />
	Such a man&rsquo;s power does not show externally, yet it can move heavy loads, like a big cart whose real strength lies in its axle.&nbsp;
	The less that power is applied outwardly, the greater its effect.

	The goat is noted for hardness outwardly and weakness within.&nbsp;

<p>
	If we venture too far we come to a deadlock, unable either to advance or to retreat and whatever we do merely serves to complicate things further.&nbsp;
	Such obstinacy leads to insuperable difficulties.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
	The hexagram represents the sun rising over the earth.&nbsp;
	It is therefore the symbol of rapid, easy progress, which at the same time means ever widening expansion and clarity.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	PROGRESS.&nbsp; The powerful prince<br />
	Is honored with horses in large numbers.<br />
	In a single day he is granted audience three times.<br />
</p>
<p>
	As an example of progress, this pictures a time when a powerful feudal lord rallies the other lords around the sovereign and pledges fealty and peace.&nbsp;
	The sovereign rewards him richly and invites him to a closer intimacy.
</p>
<p>
	A twofold idea is set forth here.&nbsp;
	The actual effect of the progress emanates from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others regard as their equal and are therefore willing to follow.&nbsp;
	This leader has enough clarity of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use it rather for the benefit of his ruler.&nbsp;
	His ruler in turn is free of all jealousy, showers presents on the great man, and invites him continually to his court.&nbsp;
	An enlightened ruler and an obedient servant&mdash;this is the condition on which great progress depends.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	The sun rises over the earth:<br />
	The image of PROGRESS.<br />
	Thus the superior man himself<br />
	Brightens his bright virtue.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The light of the sun as it rises over the earth is by nature clear.&nbsp;
	The higher the sun rises, the more it emerges from the dark mists, spreading the pristine purity of its rays over an ever widening area.&nbsp;
	The real nature of man is likewise originally good, but it becomes clouded by contact with earthly things and therefore needs purification before it can shine forth in its native clarity.

<p>
	At a time when all elements are pressing for progress, we are still uncertain whether in the course of advance we may not meet with a rebuff.&nbsp;
	Then the thing to do is simply continue in what is right; in the end this will bring good fortune.&nbsp;
	It may be that we meet with no confidence.&nbsp;
	In this case we ought not to try to win confidence regardless of the situation, but should remain calm and cheerful and refuse to be roused to anger.&nbsp;
	Thus we remain free of mistakes.
</p>

<li>Six in the second place means:<br />

<p>
	Progress is halted; an individual is kept from getting in touch with the man in authority with whom he has a connection.&nbsp;
	When this happens, he must remain persevering, although he is grieved; then with a maternal gentleness the man in question will bestow great happiness upon him.&nbsp;
	This happiness comes to him&mdash;and is well deserved&mdash;because in this case mutual attraction does not rest on selfish or partisan motives but on firm and correct principles.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the third place means:<br />

<p>
	A man strives onward, in association with others whose backing encourages him.&nbsp;

</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Progress like a hamster.<br />
	Perseverance brings danger.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In times of progress it is easy for strong men in the wrong places to amass great possessions.&nbsp;
	But such conduct shuns the light.&nbsp;
	And since times of progress are also always times in which dubious procedures are inevitably brought to the light, perseverance in such action always leads to danger.
</p>

<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	Remorse disappears.<br />
	Take not gain and loss to heart.<br />
	Undertakings bring good fortune.<br />

<p>
	The situation described here is that of one who, finding himself in an influential position in a time of progress, remains gentle and reserved.&nbsp;
	He might reproach himself for lack of energy in making the most of the propitiousness of the time and obtaining all possible advantage.&nbsp;
	However, this regret passes away.&nbsp;
	He must not take either loss or gain to heart; they are minor considerations.&nbsp;
	What matters much more is the fact that in this way he has assured himself of opportunities for successful and beneficent influence.
</p>

<p>
	Making progress with lowered horns&mdash;i.e., acting on the offensive&mdash;is permissible, in times like those referred to here, only in dealing with the mistakes of one&rsquo;s own people.&nbsp;
	Even then we must bear in mind that proceeding on the offensive may always be dangerous.&nbsp;
	In this way we avoid the mistakes that otherwise threaten, and succeed in what we set out to do.&nbsp;
	On the other hand, perseverance in such overenergetic behavior, especially toward persons with whom there is no close connection, will lead to humiliation.

<p>
	Here the sun has sunk under the earth and is therefore darkened.&nbsp;
	The name of the hexagram means literally &ldquo;wounding of the bright&rdquo;; hence the individual lines contain frequent references to wounding.&nbsp;
	The situation is the exact opposite of that in the foregoing hexagram.&nbsp;
	In the latter a wise man at the head of affairs has able helpers, and in company with them makes progress; here a man of dark nature is in a position of authority and brings harm to the wise and able man.

	DARKENING OF THE LIGHT.&nbsp; In adversity<br />
	It furthers one to be persevering.

<p>
	One must not unresistingly let himself be swept along by unfavorable circumstances, nor permit his steadfastness to be shaken.&nbsp;
	He can avoid this by maintaining his inner light, while remaining outwardly yielding and tractable.&nbsp;
	With this attitude he can overcome even the greatest adversities.
</p>
<p>
	In some situations indeed a man must hide his light, in order to make his will prevail in spite of difficulties in his immediate environment.&nbsp;
	Perseverance must dwell in inmost consciousness and should not be discernible from without.&nbsp;
	Only thus is a man able to maintain his will in the face of difficulties.

</p>
<p>
	In a time of darkness it is essential to be cautious and reserved.&nbsp;
	One should not needlessly awaken overwhelming enmity by inconsiderate behavior.&nbsp;
	In such times one ought not to fall in with the practices of others; neither should one drag them censoriously into the light.&nbsp;
	In social intercourse one should not try to be all&ndash;knowing.&nbsp;
	One should let many things pass, without being duped.

<p>
	With grandiose resolve a man endeavors to soar above all obstacles, but thus encounters a hostile fate.&nbsp;
	He retreats and evades the issue.&nbsp;
	The time is difficult.&nbsp;
	Without rest, he must hurry along, with no permanent abiding place.&nbsp;
	If he does not want to make compromises within himself, but insists on remaining true to his principles, he suffers deprivation.&nbsp;

	Here the Lord of Light is in a subordinate place and is wounded by the Lord of Darkness.&nbsp;
	But the injury is not fatal; it is only a hindrance.&nbsp;
	Rescue is still possible.&nbsp;
	The wounded man gives no thought to himself; he thinks only of saving the others who are also in danger.&nbsp;

	It seems as if chance were at work.&nbsp;
	While the strong, loyal man is striving eagerly and in good faith to create order, he meets the ringleader of the disorder, as if by accident, and seizes him.&nbsp;
	Thus victory is achieved.&nbsp;

	Prince Chi lived at the court of the evil tyrant Chou Hsin, who, although not mentioned by name, furnishes the historical example on which this whole situation is based.&nbsp;

	Although he was held a slave, he did not allow external misery to deflect him from his convictions.
<br /><br />

	The hexagram represents the laws obtaining within the family.&nbsp;
	The strong line at the top represents the father, the lowest the son.&nbsp;
	The strong line in the fifth place represents the husband, the yielding second line the wife.&nbsp;
	On the other hand, the two strong lines in the fifth and the third place represent two brothers, and the two weak lines correlated with them in the fourth and the second place stand for their respective wives.&nbsp;
	Thus all the connections and relationships within the family find their appropriate expression.&nbsp;
	Each individual line has the character according with its place.&nbsp;
	The fact that a strong line occupies the sixth place&mdash;where a weak line might be expected&mdash;indicates very clearly the strong leadership that must come from the head of the family.&nbsp;
	The line is to be considered here not in its quality as the sixth but in its quality as the top line.&nbsp;
	THE FAMILY shows the laws operative within the household that, transferred to outside life, keep the state and the world in order.&nbsp;
	The influence that goes out from within the family is represented by the symbol of the wind created by fire.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	THE FAMILY.&nbsp; The perseverance of the woman furthers.
</p>
<p>
	The foundation of the family is the relationship between husband and wife.&nbsp;
	The tie that holds the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife.&nbsp;
	Her place is within (second line), while that of the husband is without (fifth line).&nbsp;
	It is in accord with the great laws of nature that husband and wife take their proper places.&nbsp;
	Within the family a strong authority is needed; this is represented by the parents.&nbsp;
	If the father is really a father and the son a son, if the elder brother fulfills his position, and the younger fulfills his, if the husband is really a husband and the wife a wife, then the family is in order.&nbsp;
	When the family is in order, all the social relationships of mankind will be in order.
</p>
<p>
	Three of the five social relationships are to be found within the family&mdash;that between father and son, which is the relation of love, that between the husband and wife, which is the relation of chaste conduct, and that between elder and younger brother, which is the relation of correctness.&nbsp;
	The loving reverence of the son is then carried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness to duty; the affection and correctness of behavior existing between the two brothers are extended to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in the form of deference.&nbsp;
	The family is society in embryo; it is the native soil on which performance of moral duty is made easy through natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of moral practice is created, and this is later widened to include human relationships in general.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Wind comes forth from fire:<br />

	And duration in his way of life.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Heat creates energy: this is signified by the wind stirred up by the fire and issuing forth from it.&nbsp;
	This represents influence working from within outward.&nbsp;
	The same thing is needed in the regulation of the family.&nbsp;
	Here too the influence on others must proceed from one&rsquo;s own person.&nbsp;
	In order to be capable of producing such an influence, one&rsquo;s words must have power, and this they can have only if they are based on something real, just as flame depends on its fuel.&nbsp;
	Words have influence only when they are pertinent and clearly related to definite circumstances.&nbsp;
	General discourses and admonitions have no effect whatsoever.&nbsp;
	Furthermore, the words must be supported by one&rsquo;s entire conduct, just as the wind is made effective by its duration.&nbsp;
	Only firm and consistent conduct will make such an impression on others that they can adapt and conform to it.&nbsp;
	If words and conduct are not in accord and not consistent, they will have no effect.

<p>
	The family must form a well&ndash;defined unit within which each member knows his place.&nbsp;
	From the beginning each child must be accustomed to firmly established rules of order, before ever its will is directed to other things.&nbsp;
	If we begin too late to enforce order, when the will of the child has already been overindulged, the whims and passions, grown stronger with the years, offer resistance and give cause for remorse.&nbsp;
	If we insist on order from the outset, occasions for remorse may arise&mdash;in general social life these are unavoidable&mdash;but the remorse always disappears again, and everything rights itself.&nbsp;
	For there is nothing more easily avoided and more difficult to carry through than "breaking a child&rsquo;s will."

<p>
	The wife must always be guided by the will of the master of the house, be he father, husband, or grown son.&nbsp;
	Her place is within the house.&nbsp;
	There, without having to look for them, she has great and important duties.&nbsp;
	She must attend to the nourishment of her family and to the food for the sacrifice.&nbsp;
	In this way she becomes the center of the social and religious life of the family, and her perseverance in this position brings good fortune to the whole house.
<br /><br />
	In relation to general conditions, the counsel given here is to seek nothing by means of force, but quietly to confine oneself to the duties at hand.

	It leads in the end to humiliation.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In the family the proper mean between severity and indulgence ought to prevail.&nbsp;
	Too great severity toward one&rsquo;s own flesh and blood leads to remorse.&nbsp;
	The wise thing is to build strong dikes within which complete freedom of movement is allowed each individual.&nbsp;
	But in doubtful instances too great severity, despite occasional mistakes, is preferable, because it preserves discipline in the family, whereas too great weakness leads to disgrace.

<ul class="notRuler">

	Well&ndash;being prevails when expenditures and income are soundly balanced.&nbsp;
	This leads to great good fortune.&nbsp;
	In the sphere of public life, this line refers to the faithful steward whose measures further the general welfare.

<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />

	A king is the symbol of a fatherly man who is richly endowed in mind.&nbsp;
	He does nothing to make himself feared; on the contrary, the whole family can trust him, because love governs their intercourse.&nbsp;
	His character of itself exercises the right influence.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine at the top means:<br />
	His work commands respect.<br />
	In the end good fortune comes.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In the last analysis, order within the family depends on the character of the master of the house.&nbsp;
	If he cultivates his personality so that it works impressively through the force of inner truth, all goes well with the family.&nbsp;
	In a ruling position one must of his own accord assume responsibility.

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	OPPOSITION.&nbsp; In small matters, good fortune.
</p>
<p>
	When people live in opposition and estrangement they cannot carry out a great undertaking in common; their points of view diverge too widely.&nbsp;
	In such circumstances one should above all not proceed brusquely, for that would only increase the existing opposition; instead, one should limit oneself to producing gradual effects in small matters.&nbsp;
	Here success can still be expected, because the situation is such that the opposition does not preclude all agreement.
</p>
<p>
	In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when it represents polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful and important functions.&nbsp;
	The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and nature, man and woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and reproduction of life.&nbsp;
	In the world of visible things, the principle of opposites makes possible the differentiation by categories through which order is brought into the world.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Above, fire; below, the lake.<br />
	The image of OPPOSITION.<br />
	Thus amid all fellowship<br />
	The superior man retains his individuality.<br />
</p>
<p>
	The two elements, fire and water, never mingle but even when in contact retain their own natures.&nbsp;
	So the cultured man is never led into baseness or vulgarity through intercourse or community of interests with persons of another sort; regardless of all commingling, he will always preserve his individuality.
</p>

<ul class="notRuler">

	If you lose your horse, do not run after it;<br />
	It will come back of its own accord.<br />
	When you see evil people,<br />
	Guard yourself against mistakes.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Even in times when oppositions prevail, mistakes can be avoided, so that remorse disappears.&nbsp;
	When opposition begins to manifest itself, a man must not try to bring about unity by force, for by so doing he would only achieve the contrary, just as a horse goes farther and farther away if one runs after it.&nbsp;
	If it is one&rsquo;s own horse, one can safely let it go; it will come back of its own accord.&nbsp;
	So too when someone who belongs with us is momentarily estranged because of a misunderstanding, he will return of his own accord if we leave matters to him.&nbsp;
	On the other hand, it is well to be cautious when evil men who do not belong with us force themselves upon us, again as the result of a misunderstanding.&nbsp;
	Here the important thing is to avoid mistakes.&nbsp;
	We must not try to shake off these evil men by force; this would give rise to real hostility.&nbsp;
	We must simply endure them.&nbsp;
	They will eventually withdraw of their own accord.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	One meets his lord in a narrow street.<br />

<p>
	As a result of misunderstandings, it has become impossible for people who by nature belong together to meet in the correct way.&nbsp;
	This being so, an accidental meeting under informal circumstances may serve the purpose, provided there is an inner affinity between them.

	The oxen halted,<br />
	A man&rsquo;s hair and nose cut off.<br />

<p>
	Often it seems to a man as though everything were conspiring against him.&nbsp;
	He sees himself checked and hindered in his progress, insulted and dishonored.&nbsp;
	However, he must not let himself be misled; despite this opposition, he must cleave to the man with whom he knows he belongs.&nbsp;

<p>
	If a man finds himself in a company of people from whom he is separated by an inner opposition, he becomes isolated.&nbsp;
	But if in such a situation a man meets someone who fundamentally, by the very law of his being, is kin to him, and whom he can trust completely, he overcomes all the dangers of isolation.&nbsp;

<p>
	Coming upon a sincere man, one fails to recognize him at first because of the general estrangement.&nbsp;
	However, he bites his way through the wrappings that are causing the separation.&nbsp;
	When such a companion thus reveals himself in his true character, it is one&rsquo;s duty to go to meet him and to work with him.

	He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time.<br />
	As one goes, rain falls; then good fortune comes.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Here the isolation is due to misunderstanding; it is brought about not by outer circumstances but by inner conditions.&nbsp;
	A man misjudges his best friends, taking them to be as unclean as a dirty pig and as dangerous as a wagon full of devils.&nbsp;
	He adopts an attitude of defense.&nbsp;
	But in the end, realizing his mistake, he lays aside the bow, perceiving that the other is approaching with the best intentions for the purpose of close union.&nbsp;
	Thus the tension is relieved.&nbsp;
	The union resolves the tension, just as falling rain relieves the sultriness preceding a thunderstorm.&nbsp;
	All goes well, for just when opposition reaches its climax it changes over to its antithesis.

</p>
<p>
	The hexagram pictures a dangerous abyss lying before us and a steep, inaccessible mountain rising behind us.&nbsp;
	We are surrounded by obstacles; at the same time, since the mountain has the attribute of keeping still, there is implicit a hint as to how we can extricate ourselves.&nbsp;
	The hexagram represents obstructions that appear in the course of time but that can and should be overcome.&nbsp;
	Therefore all the instruction given is directed to overcoming them.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	OBSTRUCTION.&nbsp; The southwest furthers.<br />
	The northeast does not further.<br />
	It furthers one to see the great man.<br />
	Perseverance brings good fortune.
</p>
<p>
	The southwest is the region of retreat, the northeast that of advance.&nbsp;
	Here an individual is confronted by obstacles that cannot be overcome directly.&nbsp;
	In such a situation it is wise to pause in view of the danger and to retreat.&nbsp;
	However, this is merely a preparation for overcoming the obstructions.&nbsp;
	One must join forces with friends of like mind and put himself under the leadership of a man equal to the situation: then one will succeed in removing the obstacles.&nbsp;
	This requires the will to persevere just when one apparently must do something that leads away from his goal.&nbsp;
	This unswerving inner purpose brings good fortune in the end.&nbsp;
	An obstruction that lasts only for a time is useful for self&ndash;development.&nbsp;
	This is the value of adversity.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Water on the mountain:<br />
	The image of OBSTRUCTION.<br />
	Thus the superior man turns his attention to himself<br />
	And molds his character.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Difficulties and obstructions throw a man back upon himself.&nbsp;
	While the inferior man seeks to put the blame on other persons, bewailing his fate, the superior man seeks the error within himself, and through this introspection the external obstacle becomes for him an occasion for inner enrichment and education.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	Going leads to obstructions,<br />
	Coming meets with praise.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	When one encounters an obstruction, the important thing is to reflect on how best to deal with it.&nbsp;
	When threatened with danger, one should not strive blindly to go ahead, for this only leads to complications.&nbsp;
	The correct thing is,  on the contrary, to retreat for the time being, not in order to give up the struggle but to await the right moment for action.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the second place means:<br />
	The king&rsquo;s servant is beset by obstruction upon obstruction,<br />
	But it is not his own fault.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Ordinarily it is best to go around an obstacle and try to overcome it along the line of least resistance.&nbsp;
	But there is one instance in which a man must go out to meet the trouble, even though difficulty piles upon difficulty: this is when the path of duty leads directly to it&mdash;in other words, when he cannot act of his own volition but is duty bound to go and seek out danger in the service of a higher cause.&nbsp;
	Then he may do it without compunction, because it is not through any fault of his that he is putting himself in this difficult situation.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the third place means:<br />
	Going leads to obstructions;<br />
	Hence he comes back.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	While the preceding line shows the official compelled by duty to follow the way of danger, this line shows the man who must act as father of a family or as head of his kin.&nbsp;
	If he were to plunge recklessly in to danger, it would be a useless act, because those entrusted to his care cannot get along by themselves.&nbsp;
	But if he withdraws and turns back to his own, they welcome him with great joy.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the fourth place means:<br />
	Going leads to obstructions,<br />
	Coming leads to union.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This too describes a situation that cannot be managed single&ndash;handed.&nbsp;
	In such a case the direct way is not the shortest.&nbsp;
	If a person were to forge ahead on his own strength and without the necessary preparations, he would not find the support he needs and would realize too late that he has been mistaken in his calculations, inasmuch as the conditions on which he hoped he could rely would prove to be inadequate.&nbsp;
	In this case it is better, therefore, to hold back for the time being and to gather together trustworthy companions who can be counted upon for help in overcoming the obstructions.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the fifth place means:<br />
	In the midst of the greatest obstructions,<br />
	Friends come.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Here we see a man who is called to help in an emergency.&nbsp;
	He should not seek to evade the obstructions, no matter how dangerously they pile up before him.&nbsp;
	But because he is really called to the task, the power of his spirit is strong enough to attract helpers whom he can effectively organize, so that through the well&ndash;directed co&ndash;operation of all participants the obstruction is overcome.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	Going leads to obstructions,<br />
	Coming leads to great good fortune.<br />
	It furthers one to see the great man.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This refers to a man who has already left the world and its tumult behind him.&nbsp;
	When the time of obstructions arrives, it might seem that the simplest thing for him to do would be to turn his back upon the world and take refuge in the beyond.&nbsp;
	But this road is barred to him.&nbsp;
	He must not seek his own salvation and abandon the world to its adversity.&nbsp;
	Duty calls him back once more into the turmoil of life.&nbsp;
	Precisely because of his experience and inner freedom, he is able to create something both great and complete that brings good fortune.&nbsp;
	And it is favorable to see the great man in alliance with whom one can achieve the work of rescue.

</p>
<p>
	Here the movement goes out of the sphere of danger.&nbsp;
	The obstacle has been removed, the difficulties are being resolved.&nbsp;
	Deliverance is not yet achieved; it is just in its beginning, and the hexagram represents its various stages.
</p>

<h3 class="judgment">THE JUDGMENT</h3>
<p class="judgSub">
	DELIVERANCE.&nbsp; The southwest furthers.<br />
	If there is no longer anything where one has to go,<br />
	Return brings good fortune.<br />
	If there is still something where one has to go,<br />
	Hastening brings good fortune.
</p>
<p>
	This refers to a time in which tensions and complications begin to be eased.&nbsp;
	At such times we ought to make our way back to ordinary conditions as soon as possible; this is the meaning of &ldquo;the southwest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	These periods of sudden change have great importance.&nbsp;
	Just as rain relieves atmospheric tension, making all the buds burst open, so a time of deliverance from burdensome pressure has a liberating and stimulating effect on life.&nbsp;
	One thing is important, however: in such times we must not overdo our triumph.&nbsp;
	The point is not to push on farther than is necessary.&nbsp;
	Returning to the regular order of life as soon as deliverance is achieved brings good fortune.&nbsp;
	If there are any residual matters that ought to be attended to, it should be done as quickly as possible, so that a clean sweep is made and no retardations occur.
</p>

<h3 class="theImage">THE IMAGE</h3>
<p class="imageSub">
	Thunder and rain set in:<br />
	The image of DELIVERANCE.<br />

</p>
<p>
	A thunderstorm has the effect of clearing the air; the superior man produces a similar effect when dealing with mistakes and sins of men that induce a condition of tension.&nbsp;
	Through clarity he brings deliverance.&nbsp;
	However, when failings come to light, he does not dwell on them; he simply passes over mistakes, the unintentional transgressions, just as thunder dies away.&nbsp;
	He forgives misdeeds, the intentional transgressions, just as water washes everything clean.
</p>


<h3 class="lines">THE LINES</h3>

<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the beginning means:<br />
	Without blame.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In keeping with the situation, few words are needed.&nbsp;
	The hindrance is past, deliverance has come.&nbsp;
	One recuperates in peace and keeps still.&nbsp;
	This is the right thing to do in times when difficulties have been overcome.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Nine in the second place means:<br />
	One kills three foxes in the field<br />
	And receives a yellow arrow.<br />
	Perseverance brings good fortune.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The image is taken from the hunt.&nbsp;
	The hunter catches three cunning foxes and receives a yellow arrow as a reward.&nbsp;
	The obstacles in public life are the designing foxes who try to influence the ruler through flattery.&nbsp;
	They must be removed before there can be any deliverance.&nbsp;
	But the struggle must not be carried on with the wrong weapons.&nbsp;
	The yellow color points to measure and mean in proceeding against the enemy; the arrow signifies the straight course.&nbsp;
	If one devotes himself wholeheartedly to the task of deliverance, he develops so much inner strength from his rectitude that it acts as a weapon against all that is false and low.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six in the third place means:<br />
	If a man carries a burden on his back<br />
	And nonetheless rides in a carriage,<br />
	He thereby encourages robbers to draw near.<br />
	Perseverance leads to humiliation.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	This refers to a man who has come out of needy circumstances into comfort and freedom from want.&nbsp;
	If now, in the manner of an upstart, he tries to take his ease in comfortable surroundings that do not suit his nature, he thereby attracts robbers.&nbsp;
	If he goes on thus he is sure to bring disgrace upon himself.&nbsp;
	Confucius says about this line:
<br /><br />
<span class="quote">Carrying a burden on the back is the business of common man; a carriage is the appurtenance of a man of rank.&nbsp;
	Now, when a common man uses the appurtenance of man of rank, robbers plot to take it away from him.&nbsp;
	If a man is insolent toward those above him and hard toward those below him, robbers plot to attack him.&nbsp;
	Carelessness in guarding things tempts thieves to steal.&nbsp;
	Sumptuous ornaments worn by a maiden are an enticement to rob her of her virtue.</span>
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Nine in the fourth place means:<br />
	Deliver yourself from your great toe.<br />
	Then the companion comes,<br />
	And him you can trust.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	In times of standstill it will happen that inferior people attach themselves to a superior man, and through force of daily habit they may grow very close to him and become indispensable, just as the big toe is indispensable to the foot because it makes walking easier.&nbsp;
	But when the time of deliverance draws near, with its call to deeds, a man must free himself from such chance acquaintances with whom he has no inner connection.&nbsp;
	For otherwise the friends who share his views, on whom he could really rely and together with whom he could accomplish something, mistrust him and stay away.
</p>



<ul class="govRuler">
<li>Six in the fifth place means:<br />
	If only the superior man can deliver himself,<br />
	It brings good fortune.<br />
	Thus he proves to inferior men that he is in earnest.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	Times of deliverance demand inner resolve.&nbsp;
	Inferior people cannot be driven off by prohibitions or any external means.&nbsp;
	If one desires to be rid of them, he must first break completely with them in his own mind; they will see for themselves that he is in earnest and will withdraw.
</p>



<ul class="notRuler">
<li>Six at the top means:<br />
	The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall.<br />
	He kills it.&nbsp; Everything serves to further.<br /></li></ul>
<p>
	The hawk on a high wall is the symbol of a powerful inferior in a high position who is hindering the deliverance.&nbsp;
	He withstands the force of inner influences, because he is hardened in his wickedness.&nbsp;
	He must be forcibly removed, and this requires appropriate means.&nbsp;
	Confucius says about this line:
<br /><br />
<span class="quote">The hawk is the object of the hunt; bow and arrow are the tools and means.&nbsp;
	The marksman is man (who must make proper use of the means to his end).&nbsp;
	The superior man contains the means in his own person.&nbsp;
	He bides his time and then acts.&nbsp;
	Why then should not everything go well? He acts and is free.&nbsp;
	Therefore all he has to do is to go forth, and he takes his quarry.&nbsp;
	This is how a man fares who acts after he has made ready the means.</span>

</p>
<p>
	This hexagram represents a decrease of the lower trigram in favor of the upper, because the third line, originally strong, has moved up to the top, and the top line, originally weak, has replaced it.&nbsp;
	What is below is decreased to the benefit of what is above.&nbsp;
	This is out&ndash;and&ndash;out decrease.&nbsp;
	If the foundations of a building are decreased in strength and the upper walls are strengthened, the whole structure loses its stability.&nbsp;
	Likewise, a decrease in the prosperity of the people in favor of the government is out&ndash;and&ndash;out decrease.&nbsp;
	And the entire theme of the hexagram is directed to showing how this shift of wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth in the nation and its lower classes to fail.

	One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
	Decrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad.&nbsp;
	Increase and decrease come in their own time.&nbsp;
	What matters here is to understand the time and not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense.&nbsp;
	If a time of scanty resources brings out an inner truth, one must not feel ashamed of simplicity.&nbsp;
	For simplicity is then the very thing needed to provide inner strength for further undertakings.&nbsp;
	Indeed, there need be no concern if the outward beauty of the civilization, even the elaboration of religious forms, should have to suffer because of simplicity.&nbsp;
	One must draw on the strength of the inner attitude to compensate for what is lacking in externals; then the power of the content makes up for the simplicity of form.&nbsp;
	There is no need of presenting false appearances to God.&nbsp;
	Even with slender means, the sentiment of the heart can be expressed.

	At the foot of the mountain, the lake:<br />

<p>
	The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates.&nbsp;
	In this way it decreases to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture.&nbsp;
	The mountain stands as the symbol of a stubborn strength that can harden into anger.&nbsp;
	The lake is the symbol of unchecked gaiety that can develop into passionate drives at the expense of the life forces.&nbsp;
	Therefore decrease is
	necessary; anger must be decreased by keeping still, the instincts must be
	curbed by restriction.&nbsp;
	By this decrease of the lower powers of the psyche, the higher aspects of the soul are enriched.

<p>
	It is unselfish and good when a man, after completing his own urgent tasks, uses his strength in the service of others, and without bragging or making much of it, helps quickly where help is needed.&nbsp;

	His faults are sometimes reinforced by the environment in which he lives.&nbsp;
